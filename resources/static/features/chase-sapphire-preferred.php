            <h1>Chase Sapphire Preferred</h1>
            <p>Consistently ranked as one of the best credit cards for travel rewards, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card is a worthy contender for your go-to card. This review lays out the pros and cons, along with tips on how to redeem your points at the best value.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Earn 2x points on travel, 2x points on dining at restaurants and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. Your points will have 20 percent higher redemption value when you redeem for airfare, hotels, car rentals and cruises through the Chase Ultimate Rewards program. At the moment you can earn 50,000 bonus points + an additional 5,000 for adding an authorized card member.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>50,000 bonus points earned after you spend $4,000 in the first three months from account opening. Those 50,000 points can be redeemed for $625 in travel through Ultimate Rewards, or $500 cash back. Rewards can also be transferred at a 1:1 ratio to a number of Chase's travel partners. Think Marriott, Southwest, etc.</li>
                    <li>5,000 additional bonus points after you add the first authorized user and they make a purchase in the first three months from account opening</li>
                    <li>Introductory Annual Fee of $0 the first year, then $95</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>How do you earn points?</h2>
            <p>With the Chase Sapphire Preferred, you'll earn:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1 point per dollar on regular purchases</li>
                    <li>2 points per dollar on dining at restaurants</li>
                    <li>Up to 10 points per dollar at nearly 300 top online retailers when you access those websites through the Ultimate Rewards Mall portal.</li>
                    <li>No caps on reward earnings</li>
                    <li>Use the CSP in combination with the Chase Freedom. Chase allows points for the two cards to be combined, meaning the 5% cash back you earn in rotating categories throughout the year with the Freedom card, can be redeemed for travel when transferred to your CSP!</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>How do you redeem points?</h2>
            <p>The Chase "Ultimate Rewards" program is robust and has a lot of redemption options (including cash back). But as you probably guessed, the most popular option is using them for travel rewards. It's a fair and flexible program:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>No Expiration Dates &mdash; Your points will be there as long as you have the card.</li>
                    <li>No Blackout Dates &mdash; You can use your points for airfare and other travel purchases without restrictions.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>For travel, here's how it works...</p>
            <p>You're not limited to just airline tickets. Book with more than 60,000 hotels and resorts across the globe. Take a cruise with Royal Caribbean or Carnival. You can use points to pay for a rental car and even airport parking. Almost any travel purchase can be paid for with points using the following conversion:</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">1 point = 1 full cent towards the travel purchase of your choice</div>
            <br>
            <p><u>There are no blackout dates or restrictions</u> when redeeming points. If you find a plane ticket that costs $371, you could pay for it using 37,100 points. Just remember - using the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal will give you 20% more buying power. That $371 ticket would require only 29,680 points.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another great option you have with the Sapphire Preferred is the unique ability to convert your rewards to miles or points for a variety of loyalty programs with a full 1-for-1 conversion. The partner programs are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>United Airlines Mileage Plus</li>
                    <li>British Airways Avios</li>
                    <li>Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards</li>
                    <li>Korean Air Skypass</li>
                    <li>Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer</li>
                    <li>Marriott Rewards</li>
                    <li>Ritz-Carlton Rewards</li>
                    <li>Hyatt Gold Passport</li>
                    <li>Virgin Atlantic Flying Club</li>
                    <li>IHG Rewards Club</li>
                    <li>Amtrak Guest Rewards</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Other ways to spend your points:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cash Back &mdash; You can always opt for cash rewards (via direct deposit or statement credit) and get 1 cent per point in value.</li>
                    <li>Gift Cards &mdash; Choose gift cards from dozens of partner retailers, restaurants, and gas stations. The selection varies, but past offerings have included Amazon, Target, Starbucks, Home Depot, Nordstrom, and Applebee's. </li>
                    <li>Entertainment &mdash; The Chase Sapphire rewards program gives you access to once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Use points to sit front and center at top concerts, shows, and events. </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>The annual fee may initially seem like a drawback, but if you take full advantage of the rewards and the perks listed above, it can be well worth the eventual cost. Plus, you get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, so you can test it out before deciding to keep it and pay the fee. Finally, it leaves quite an impression when you plop it on the table to pay for dinner since it's made out of metal!</p>
                <p>If you're in the market for a superior all around travel rewards card that offers a lucrative signup bonus, a strong earnings structure and exceptional points transfer capabilities, then look no further.</p>
