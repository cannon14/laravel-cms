			<h1>3 Cash Back Cards that Offer Simple Savings</h1>
			<p>There's a reason why the rich keep getting richer. In a recent poll conducted for Creditcards.com, nearly 800 wealthy individuals with investable assets of $100,000 or more were asked to choose their preferred medium of rewards when selecting a credit card. There was no contest. A whopping 60% of participants polled chose cash back as their favorite credit card reward. If living like you're rich means earning more cash back, maybe it's high time for the rest of us to get in on the cash back action. </p>

			<p>For anyone looking for a solid cash back card, but especially Bank of America customers, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards&#8482; credit card is a great option that provides cash back in the form of 2% at grocery stores and 3% on gas for the first $1,500 in combined grocery store and gas purchases each quarter. You will earn 1% cash back on all other purchases, alongside an online-exclusive sign-up bonus of $100 cash back when you spend $500 on purchases in your first 90 days as a cardholder. Moreover, if you are a Bank of America customer, you will receive an extra 10% customer bonus when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America&#174; checking or savings account, and your rewards never expire. That's right; you get cash back for getting your cash back!</p>

			<p>With the Citi&reg; Double Cash Card, a CreditCards.com Partner, you receive 1% base rewards as you spend, and another 1% cash back for the amount you pay on your balance&mdash;hence the name, Double Cash. The best part? It doesn't matter where or what you spend your money on&mdash;the rewards are unlimited and they don't expire as long as your card is active at least once every 12 months. One drawback is the lack of a sign-up bonus, so you would need to spend $5,000 just to equal the $100 bonus that other cards offer ($5,000 x 2% = $100). So you will want to do the math and see if your monthly spend makes this a good option or not.</p>
