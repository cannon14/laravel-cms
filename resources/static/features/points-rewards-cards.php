			&mdash; <em>40,000 Bonus Miles</em>
			<p>When you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months of your account opening, you will receive the Venture card's new customer bonus, which is the equivalent of $400 when redeemed for travel. The best part is that you are free to spend that bonus however you choose, with this No Hassle Rewards card. Simply make your travel purchase with whatever airline, hotel, or other travel resource you wish. Enjoy earning unlimited 2x reward miles per $1 spent on all purchases, then go online to CapitalOne.com, or call the Capital One Rewards Center to utilize the Purchase Eraser to redeem your miles in the form of an account credit. You have so much freedom in redemption with Capital One, in fact, that you are able to redeem for taxes, fees, cab fare, bus fare, travel agencies and other travel expenses often overlooked by other rewards programs.</p>

			<p>A flexible point card is crucial to a well-rounded wallet. Truly a card for a jetsetter, enjoy no foreign transaction fees, 2x rewards points on travel and dining, and 1x rewards points on all other purchases. Chase Ultimate Rewards can be transferred to a number of rewards programs such as Starwood, Southwest, Marriot, etc. To earn the new customer bonus, you must spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months of account opening. Doing this will earn you 50,000 bonus points. Because Ultimate Rewards offers a 20% discount on all travel booked through their program, your bonus which would otherwise be worth $500, becomes $625. Do not forget, if you add an authorized user who makes a purchase within the first 3 months, you'll receive another 5,000 bonus points!</p>
