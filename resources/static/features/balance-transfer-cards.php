			<h1>Balance Transfer Cards for 2015</h1>
			<p>The new year has since come and gone, and unfortunately for many of us, so have our resolutions. According to StatisticsBrain.com, a whopping 34% of Americans made a money related resolution for 2015. Unfortunately, a majority of those resolutions didn't last past January. In effort to aid your resolve, we've compiled a list of balance transfer cards to help trim down your balances. Let's make 2016 the year of low debt and travel rewards!</P>

			<p>1. <a href="/credit-cards/slate-from-chase.php?catid=25">Chase Slate&reg;</a> is perfect for someone looking for a card focused solely for balance reduction. It's the only card on this list to provide its customers with a welcomed and rare $0 intro balance transfer fee for balance transfers made within the first 60 days of account opening, in conjunction with a 15 month introductory rate. Think about it&mdash;if you use this card as "storage space" alone and are able to pay off your balance within the 15 month of 0% intro APR period, the ONLY thing it would have cost you is a few points dinged on your credit score from the hard inquiry pull. A variable rate of 12.99% - 22.99% applies after your introductory period has ended. Thus, Chase Slate&#174; provides a safe and interest-free place for you to keep that balance for 15 months, without any added pressure as you work it down.</p><br>

			<p>2. <a href="/credit-cards/bankamericard-visa-card.php?catid=23">BankAmericard&#174; Credit Card</a> offers a generous introductory period of 18 billing cycles for balance transfers made in the first 60 days of account opening. A variable rate of 10.99% - 20.99% applies after your introductory period has ended. A 3% balance transfer fee applies, with a minimum fee of $10. This is the lowest available interest rate among all BankAmericard products. This card is perfect for those seeking a simple credit card to pay off any high balances, or make a large new purchase.</p>

			<p>3. <a href="/credit-cards/citi-diamond-preferred-card-22146011.php?catid=26">Citi&#174; Diamond Preferred&#174;</a>, a CreditCards.com Partner, is also a great choice for anyone looking to pay off their balance over an extended period of time, without sacrificing earning rewards. Citi Diamond Preferred provides a generous introductory period of 21 months during which you pay no interest on purchases or balance transfers. A variable rate of 11.99% - 21.99% applies thereafter.  While the card's rewards program isn't the strongest, you will still earn Citi Easy Deals Points for the purchases you are making, so you won't be entirely denied the pleasure of splurging on items with points. Easy Deal Points can be redeemed for online deals on name-brand merchandise, gift cards, and local deals.</p>
			<br>

			<p>With these cards on your side, it's not too late to take control of high balances. Whether you're looking for a simple card with no frills, to avoid a balance transfer fee, or dabble in a reward program while paying off high balances, there's a product available to help you meet your goals. </p>
