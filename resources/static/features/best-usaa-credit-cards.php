			<h1>USAA Credit Cards &mdash; the Perks of Membership</h1>
			<p>USAA started its roots in 1922, when a small group of Army officers agreed to insure each other's vehicles when no one else would. USAA is constantly receiving praise from its members for providing great service. You might not know this, but USAA products are available to more than just active military members.  Membership is open to U.S. military service members, veterans with an honorable discharge, and their eligible family members. This means that if one of your parents served in the military, there is a good chance you're eligible for membership. Membership is free, and when you join, you have access to financial resources, special savings, and award-winning service. Additional benefits for active-duty and deployed members are also available.</p><br>
			<p>USAA offers a variety of credit cards to meet their member's needs. Check out the list of our favorite cards from USAA below.</p>
			<br><br>

			<p>1. <a href="/oc/?pid=231210675&pg=10&pgpos=&catid=10" target="_blank">USAA Rewards&reg; World MasterCard&reg; with Chip Technology </a>
			<br>
				The USAA Rewards World MasterCard is our top pick for a flexible point card. This card will earn you 2,500 bonus points after making your first purchase, and an additional point for every dollar you spend. Points can be redeemed for cash, gift cards, merchandise, or travel. For example, 25,300 points will get you a $300 cruise certificate. On top of that, this card offers an APR starting at 9.9% with no annual fee. Rewards cards are typically loaded with fees and higher APRs, making this card pretty unique.</p>

			<p>2. <a href="/oc/?pid=23126379&pg=10&pgpos=&catid=10" target="_blank">USAA Cash Rewards&reg; American Express&reg; Card </a>
			<br>
			Maybe  you're more interested in earning cash back on your everyday spend. The USAA  Cash Rewards card is a serious contender in this space. This card offers 2.25%  cash back on gas and grocery purchases year round, as well as 1.25% cash back  on all other purchases. This is better than your standard 1% cash back you'll  see on many competing products. As with the Rewards MasterCard discussed above,  this card offers a starting APR of 9.9%, and no annual fee. A great find for  the bargain savvy.</p>

			<p>3. <a href="/oc/?pid=231210676&pg=10&pgpos=&catid=10" target="_blank">USAA Classic Platinum Visa&reg;</a>
			<br>
				Not as flashy as the first two products on our list, the USAA Classic Platinum Visa card is best for users with average credit. While this card doesn't earn cash back or travel rewards, if you make consistent, on-time payments you could improve your credit rating in as little as 12 months. Furthermore, USAA will periodically consider you for an automatic upgrade to one of their premium credit cards. With responsible use, the USAA Classic Platinum may could put you on the path to the premium rewards card you've been looking for.</p><br>

			<p>4. <a href="/oc/?pid=23126385&pg=10&pgpos=&catid=10" target="_blank">USAA Secured Card&reg; Platinum MasterCard&reg;</a>
			<br>
			The  Secured card for USAA is a good option for those without any previous credit history, or those who have had some credit hiccups in the past. With the  secured card, a user opens a USAA 2 year certificate of deposit when applying  for the card. Deposits may be as little as $250, all the way up to $5,000. Your  CD will earn you interest, while giving you access to a line of credit equal to  the amount you deposit. Use your new line of credit responsibly, and you'll be  on your way to rebuilding your credit.</p>
