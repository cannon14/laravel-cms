			<h1>3 Credit Cards Money Can't Buy</h1>
			<p>If you believe that money can't buy happiness, then the cards below are for you! These cards come with no annual fee, but don't skimp on other perks like rewards, 0% introductory APRs, or welcome bonuses. Using a no annual fee card to earn rewards is like getting a bonus for purchases you're already making, and that's something we can all smile about.</p>

			<p>With a considerable sign-up bonus of 20,000 miles (the equivalent of $200) when you spend $1,000 in your first 3 months, this card immediately grasps your attention. And there's more. A 0% introductory APR for 12 months is offered (11.9%-21.9% Variable APR thereafter), and a straightforward 1.25x miles rewarded for every $1 spent on net purchases. The most important thing to note about miles redemption is that Capital One's program allows you to pay for travel expenses first, then redeem miles for credits on your statement. Thus, instead of having to operate your redemption within a particular program's travel guidelines or partnerships, you have the freedom to redeem for whatever travel expenses you would like&mdash;cab rides, bus fare, time shares, taxes and fees... you name it. Thus, this is the ideal no annual fees card for the practical traveler.</p>
