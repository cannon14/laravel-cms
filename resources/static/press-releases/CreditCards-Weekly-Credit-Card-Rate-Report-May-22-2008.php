			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin,   Texas - Annual percentage rates  for select major credit card categories declined this week, but minutes from  the latest Federal Reserve meeting hinted that the Fed would pause its  rate-cutting activity. That approach to monetary policy would leave banks with  little reason to further lower APRs on variable interest rate credit cards. </p>
			<p>According to the Fed, 57 percent of banks index their  credit card APRs to the prime rate, with most adjusting variable rates 30 days  or one billing cycle after the prime rate changes.</p>
			<p>Of the nine card categories tracked by CreditCards.com, six  had lower rates, two categories rose and one held steady. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>The Fed minutes indicated that in light of previous  actions, &quot;most members&quot; considered the late April decision to cuts  interest rates a &quot;close call.&quot; Going forward, many Fed officials  believe further monetary policy loosening is unlikely even if the economy  worsens. </p>
			<p>The central bank's poor view of the economy was confirmed  this week by Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who labeled economic conditions  &quot;quite difficult.&quot; </p>
