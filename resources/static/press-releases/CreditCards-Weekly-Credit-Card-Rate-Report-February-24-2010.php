			<p>Credit card APRs rose steadily over the months prior to the  enactment of the Credit CARD Act's major provisions, which took effect on  Monday. Citi, one of the many issuers that recently hiked APRs, acknowledged  that its recent pricing adjustments stemmed from higher losses due to  delinquent cardholders as well as the limitations the CARD Act places on its  ability to reprice for risk. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
