			<p>Chase spurred this week&rsquo;s rate change by adjusting the APR range
			on its Slate card. Chase raised the range&rsquo;s bottom end slightly
			from 11.24 percent to 11.99 percent and lowered the card&rsquo;s top end
			from 22.24 percent to 21.99 percent. </p>
			<p>Citi also made significant moves this week. The bank raised the
			top ends of both the Forward card and the mtvU Platinum Select card
			by a full percentage point, leaving both cards at a range of 12.99
			percent to 20.99 percent. However, because CreditCards.com uses
			only a card&rsquo;s lowest available rate in its calculations, the
			bank&rsquo;s moves didn&rsquo;t affect the national average.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
