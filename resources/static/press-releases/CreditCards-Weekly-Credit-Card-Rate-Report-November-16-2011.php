			<p>The average annual percentage rate (APR) held at 14.99 percent for a
			second straight week. That's just 0.01 percent shy of the national APR
			average record high, which was set in mid-October.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The only rate change we saw this week came from Citi. It raised
			the top end of the APR range on its Citi Forward card from 20.99
			percent to 22.99 percent. The lower end of the range remained at
			12.99 percent. Since we only include a card's lowest available rate
			in our calculations, the move did not impact the national average. </p>
			<p>Citi did not offer comment on the change prior to the release of
			this report.</p>

			rates will vary with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based
			pricing policies. </p>
