			<p>The national average remained unchanged despite Bank of  America raising the upper range of APRs for some cards. The issuer is hardly  alone in making changes, however. According to the Fed's latest survey of  senior loan officers, nearly 60 percent of banks tightened lending standards on  credit card and other consumer loans in the fourth quarter. Additionally, just  over half of respondents said they were less willing to offer credit cards and  other consumer loans to borrowers with poor credit, while slightly less than  half said they raised minimum credit score requirements.</p>
			<p>Further insight into how those lending standards may have  impacted credit card balances will be provided tomorrow via the Fed's December G.19  report on consumer credit. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
