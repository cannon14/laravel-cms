			<p>Fed Chairman Bernanke, in a speech before Harvard's  graduating class on Wednesday, voiced "significant concern" regarding  increases in longer-term inflation expectations over recent months, suggesting  the Fed could raise interest rates. "We will need to monitor that  situation closely," he said. However, the Fed chief also highlighted economic  differences from when he was an undergraduate. "Importantly, we see little  indication today of the beginnings of a 1970s-style wage-price spiral, in which  wages and prices chased each other ever upward," Bernanke said. </p>
			<p>With little major economic news out so far this week,  tomorrow's data on May employment and April consumer credit could provide a  focus for analysts following credit card usage. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
