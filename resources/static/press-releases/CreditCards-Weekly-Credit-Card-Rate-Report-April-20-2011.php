			<p>The national average APR climbed to 14.67 percent this week, its first
			jump since late February.</p>
			<p>The move was spurred by Chase&rsquo;s removal of its +1 Student
			MasterCard from the market. CreditCards.com, in turn, removed that
			card from its database, replacing it with Capital One's Journey
			Student Rewards card.&nbsp; The Chase card carried an APR range
			of 17.24 percent to 21.24 percent, while the Capital One card&rsquo;s
			APR is 19.8 percent. Because the Capital One card&rsquo;s APR is
			higher than the low end of the Chase card&rsquo;s range, the switch
			sent the national average slightly higher overall.</p>
			<p>Chase &ldquo;is not focused at all on college students as credit
			card customers,&rdquo; Chase spokeswoman Gail Hurdis says.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
