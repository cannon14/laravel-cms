			<p>The only APR change in our database this week came from  Wells Fargo, which boosted the top end of the APR range for its Wells Fargo  College Card. When reached for comment, Wells Fargo said it routinely adjusts  its card pricing based on market conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;</p>
			<p>That increase didn't affect interest rates, however, since  CreditCards.com calculates the average rate using the low end of any APR  ranges.</p>
			<p>Last week, Wells Fargo raised rates on four of its card  offers, pushing the national average higher and ending a record five-week run  of declines. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
