			<p>Credit card issuers continued to be largely unresponsive to  the Federal Reserve's mid-December interest rate cut. That meeting's minutes, released  Tuesday, showed the Fed considering other options to reinvigorate the economy  after lowering rates as far as it can. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Those minutes also showed that the central bank &quot;revised  down sharply its outlook for economic activity in 2009,&quot; even as  policymakers still anticipate a &quot;moderate recovery&quot; for 2010.  Additionally, the Fed's outlook for employment worsened from its October  meeting, with predictions calling for the unemployment rate to &quot;rise  significantly into 2010.&quot; That weak economic outlook appeared to be supported  by the latest retail sales figures, which showed that retailers suffered poor  December results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement  may be influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
