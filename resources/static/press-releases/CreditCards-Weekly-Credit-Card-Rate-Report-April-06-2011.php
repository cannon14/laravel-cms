			<p>The national average APR on introductory credit card offers held steady
			at 14.65 percent. It has been static for most of 2011, but is still up
			from six months ago, when it stood at 14.35 percent. </p>
			<p>Although APRs remained unchanged, issuers aren't just sitting on
			their hands. Several major card issuers, including Citi, American
			Express and Discover, adjusted introductory purchase and balance
			transfer offers on various cards in the past week.</p>
			<p>For example, Citi increased the length of the introductory period
			for purchases and balance transfers from 18 to 21 months for its
			Platinum Select MasterCard. Discover extended the introductory period
			for purchases from 12 months to 15 months on its More card. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
