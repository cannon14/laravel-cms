			<p>Austin,   Texas -- Annual percentage rates  for select major credit card categories were largely unchanged this week, although  APRs for low interest and student credit cards posted notable increases.  Tomorrow's release of the July employment report could prove to be an economic  focus.</p>

			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>Already this week, gross domestic product data indicated second-quarter  growth, although revised figures showed an economic contraction in the final  months of last year amid a slowdown in consumer spending. Consumer expenditures  account for approximately 70 percent of GDP. </p>
			<p>Recessionary concerns may keep policymakers from raising  interest rates this year. The Fed said Wednesday that it is extending lending  programs to investment banks through January, citing "continued fragile  circumstances in financial markets." Against that backdrop, the Fed is expected  to leave interest rates unchanged at 2 percent when it next meets on Aug. 5. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement  may also have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
