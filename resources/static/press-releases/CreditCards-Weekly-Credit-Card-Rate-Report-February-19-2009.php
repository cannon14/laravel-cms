			<p>While Bank of America adjusted its rates, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke expressed confidence that the central bank's upcoming Term  Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) program will encourage lending by providing  a means &quot;for banks to get cheaper financing for their credit card credit.&quot;  In a speech Wednesday, Bernanke said credit card securitization markets --  which the industry relies upon heavily for financing -- &quot;are very  substantially shut down during the [credit] crisis, which means that credit  card credit is available only at high cost and under very tight terms.&quot; Until  that changes, lending will remain slow.</p>
