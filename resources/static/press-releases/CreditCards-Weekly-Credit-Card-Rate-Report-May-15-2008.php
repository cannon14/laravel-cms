			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas - Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories firmed this week. Despite an aggressive Federal Reserve  campaign that has lowered interest rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent in  September, the latest pricing data suggests inflation remains controlled, reducing  pressure on the Fed to begin tightening monetary policy. </p>
			<p>Of the nine card categories tracked by CreditCards.com, five  had higher rates, two categories declined and two remained unchanged. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>Economic weakness appears to be limiting inflation, as  consumer prices rose only modestly in April. When volatile food and energy  prices are removed, the so-called &quot;core&quot; consumer price index rose at  a year-over-year pace of 2.3 percent last month, above the central bank's  preferred target of a 1.5 percent to 2 percent gain. Over the past three months,  core prices increased at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent. </p>
			<p>While some Fed officials have expressed concerns regarding  inflation, recent earnings reports suggest that the sluggish economy is making  it tougher for companies to pass along higher commodity prices. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
