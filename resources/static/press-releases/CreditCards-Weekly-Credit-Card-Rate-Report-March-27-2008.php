			<p>The latest economic news confirmed a slowdown. Gross  domestic product advanced at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the fourth  quarter. That marked a significant deceleration from the 4.9 percent pace in  the third quarter. Meanwhile, February durable goods orders fell unexpectedly. </p>
			<p>"The economy is in a slowdown that resembles past  periods that were the leading edge of a recession," Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart said during a speech in Tennessee. "I believe that an  important policy objective at this juncture is to ensure that this slowdown is  short and shallow," he added. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
