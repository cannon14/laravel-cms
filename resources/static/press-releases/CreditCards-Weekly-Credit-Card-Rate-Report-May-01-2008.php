			<p>On Wednesday, the central bank lowered the federal funds rate  by one-quarter of a percentage point. Ordinarily, that would cause credit card  rates to fall, since most are indirectly linked to the federal funds rate, but  the credit crisis has made the financial industry less willing to pass the rate  cuts along. </p>
			<p>The Fed said its series of moves "should help to  promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic  activity." </p>
			<p>The economy could use a boost: Excluding inventories, first-quarter  gross domestic product data showed an economic contraction. </p>
			<p>The Fed's statement also signaled that this may be the  last rate cut for awhile. </p>
			<p>Meanwhile, consumer spending accelerated in March even as  income slowed, suggesting a greater reliance on credit cards.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
