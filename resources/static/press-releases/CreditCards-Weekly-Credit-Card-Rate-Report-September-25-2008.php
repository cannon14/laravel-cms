			<p>Against a backdrop of significant financial turmoil, the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, which would prevent what consumer advocates call abusive practices by the card issuers. The banking industry argued against the bill, saying it will limit issuers' ability to manage risk and have the unintended consequence of restricting access to credit and increasing interest rates.</p>
			<p>With a severe crisis taking place in the financial sector, the government is looking to hastily put up to $700 billion toward shoring up Wall Street. In a speech Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged that the credit crunch has spilled out of mortgage lending, making credit cards and other consumer loans harder to get.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked.</p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary with applicantsï¿½ credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
