			<p>The national average annual percentage rate (APR) on new  card offers held steady at 14.92 percent Wednesday after dipping the previous  week.</p>
			<p>None of the cards that CreditCards.com tracks featured offer  changes this week. That&rsquo;s not unusual in the current card climate. In the past  two months, credit card offers, including promotional balance transfers and  purchase rates, have remained unchanged five weeks out of eight.</p>
			<p>In the past two months, just three issuers -- Barclays, U.S.  Bank and Bank of America â€“ changed promotions on the cards that CreditCards.com  tracks. Similarly, just three issuers -- Discover, Citi and PNC Bank -- altered  rates.</p>
			<p>The relative lack of movement is unusual when you compare it  to previous years when issuers adjusted offers more often. <br>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>)  is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'  websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
