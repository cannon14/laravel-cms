			<p>The national average annual percentage rate (APR) remained  at 14.95 percent Wednesday. This is the third straight week that issuers have  left credit card APRs alone.</p>
			<p>Despite leaving interest rates alone this week, some issuers  have been experimenting with other card terms over the past month.</p>
			<p>Last week, for example, American Express sweetened the  promotional terms on three of its flagship cards. Applicants who apply for the  Blue Cash card, the Blue Sky card or the Blue card may now qualify for  interest-free balance transfers for up to 15 months. The issuer also extended  the amount of time cardholders can carry a balance without paying interest from  12 months to 15 months.</p>
			<p>Barclays also tested a new promotional offer this month.</p>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey  (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>)  is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'  websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.
