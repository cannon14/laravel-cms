			<p>We found no APR changes for any of the credit card offers we track, so
			the average annual percentage rate (APR) on new credit card offers remained
			at 14.91 percent for the second straight week. That&rsquo;s the highest
			level since CreditCards.com began tracking APRs in 2007. </p>
			<p>Though APRs were steady this week, they&rsquo;ve risen sharply
			since April, thanks in part to rising reward card APRs. Since April,
			the average APR on a rewards card offer has jumped from 14.32 percent
			to 14.51 percent. According to CreditCards.com data, that&rsquo;s
			nothing new. For the past three years, rewards card APRs have consistently
			surged in April and May, heading into summer vacation.&nbsp; For
			example, it was 14.29 percent in April 2010 before climbing to 14.75
			percent by June 2010. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
