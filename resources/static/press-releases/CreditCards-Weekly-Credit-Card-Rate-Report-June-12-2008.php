			<p>The Federal Reserve's beige book report noted that the  economy "remained generally weak" in late April and May, as consumer spending  slowed amid higher food and energy prices. Fed districts also reported  "further tightening" in credit standards for consumer loans. </p>
			<p>Nevertheless, retail sales jumped last month, as consumers  apparently put their stimulus checks to work. The Office of the Comptroller of  the Currency said credit card lending standards tightened this year and a  Federal Reserve report late last week showed credit card use slowed  significantly in April. Even with decreasing credit card activity, retail sales  growth for both April and March was revised sharply higher.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
