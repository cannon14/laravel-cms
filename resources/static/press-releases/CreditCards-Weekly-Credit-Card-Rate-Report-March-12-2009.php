			<p>With those credit cards in hand, consumers headed back to  the stores in early 2009. Data released today showed that retail sales were  basically flat last month following a 1.8 percent gain in January. When slumping  auto purchases were excluded, retail sales actually increased 0.7 percent in  February. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>However, as rising unemployment shuts off cash flows,  cardholders may struggle to pay for their purchases. Fitch Ratings reported  this week that consumers are falling farther behind on their credit card bills,  with its credit card delinquency rate reaching an all-time high at the end of  January. Additionally, credit bureau TransUnion predicted that card delinquency  rates will advance into next year. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
