			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas -- Annual percentage rates for new credit card  offers rose this week, according to the CreditCards.com Weekly Credit Card Rate  Report. However, that move was due to a change in the composition of cards  offered rather than any APR increases by banks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Of the nine credit card categories tracked by  CreditCards.com, seven increased and two were unchanged. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below: </p>

			<p>While banks temporarily left APRs unchanged, rates are  likely to move in the near future. According to a report from the Wall Street  Journal, Citi plans to boost interest rates by three percentage points for  select cardholders due to losses in its global card business. </p>
			<p>Additionally, minutes from its late October meeting suggest  the Federal Reserve is likely to lower rates further. At the meeting, which  yielded a half percentage point cut, committee members said they expected  &quot;significant weakness in economic activity,&quot; with some suggesting that  further rate cuts could be appropriate at upcoming meetings. Overall, Fed  policymakers agreed they would &quot;take whatever steps were necessary to  support the recovery of the economy.&quot; </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
