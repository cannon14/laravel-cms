			<p>Discover raised its Discover Business card&rsquo;s APR, sending the national
			average higher. The card&rsquo;s APR climbed to a range of 12.99 percent
			to 19.99 percent. Before the move, the range was 10.99 percent to 18.99
			percent. </p>
			<p>When asked to comment, Discover did not respond.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The change to our business cards category is the first of its kind
			in 2011. The last time we saw a change to the national APR average
			for business cards was mid-November of 2010, when it fell to 12.91
			percent. However, as many businesses struggle in a challenging economy,
			any increases drive home the importance of doing adequate research
			before acquiring a business card.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
