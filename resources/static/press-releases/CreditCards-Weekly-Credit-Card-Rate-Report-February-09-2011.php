			<p>This week continues a recent trend of inactivity for card issuers. None
			of the issuers that CreditCards.com tracks made APR moves this week, marking
			the sixth time in 11 weeks that the national average APR has remained
			unchanged. During that period, the national average has declined only
			once.</p>
			<p>This month also marks the one-year anniversary of the national
			average topping 14 percent for the first time since CreditCards.com
			began tracking rates in mid-2007. According to CreditCards.com data,
			interest rates shot up nearly 1 percentage point to 14.12 percent
			on Feb. 3, 2010. That&rsquo;s just shortly before major provisions
			of the Credit CARD Act went into effect on Feb. 22, 2010. The national
			average hasn&rsquo;t dipped below 14 percent since.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
			<p>About CreditCards.com<br>
