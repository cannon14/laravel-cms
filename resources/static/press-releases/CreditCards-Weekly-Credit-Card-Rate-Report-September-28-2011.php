			<p>The average annual percentage rate (APR) rose to 14.97 percent, up from the previous high of 14.96 percent, where the rate had stood the previous two weeks.  The national APR average has set record highs three times in the past five weeks, marking the first time since CreditCards.com began tracking rates in 2007 that records have broken so frequently.</p>
			<p>Chase spurred the increase, raising the rate on its Marriott Rewards Visa Signature card from 14.24 percent to 15.24 percent.</p>
			<p>Barclays raised the top end of the APR range offered for its NFL Extra Points Visa from 17.74 percent to 22.74 percent. The low end stayed at 13.74 percent. Since only the low ends of APR ranges are used in our calculations, the national average was not affected.</p>

			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
