			Any future rate increases that might ripple through to the credit card market would be aimed at tightening the supply of credit and reducing consumer spending by increasing the cost of funds to lenders.
			</p>
			<p>
			Federal Reserve officials appeared to be somewhat more positive about the strength of the U.S. economy, according to minutes from the meeting on May 9. Although data released since that meeting supports a likely economic recovery from the prior quarter, the Fed also stressed that the housing sector should continue to pressure the economy.
			</p>
			<p>
			Beyond the housing market, employment levels and the consumer price index are closely watched by the Federal Reserve to gauge pressure on the nation's money supply.
			</p>
			<p>
			Separately, data from an April 2007 Federal Reserve loan officer opinion survey indicated that banks somewhat eased their standards for approving credit card applications in the first quarter, potentially increasing available credit in the marketplace.
			</p>
			<p>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted each week using data from the leading credit card issuers in the United States.
			</p>
			<p>
			Introductory offer periods and actual regular interest rates can vary depending on individual applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.
