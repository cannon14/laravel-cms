			<p>The Fed left the federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent  last week. That means an unchanged prime rate, which banks use to set APRs on  variable rate cards. Still, banks have the freedom to increase APRs on card  offers to protect themselves, should economic conditions drive delinquencies  higher. According to the Fed's quarterly survey of senior loan officers,  issuers had already sharply tightened lending standards in July. </p>
			<p>Although the consumer price index showed inflation reaching  a 17-year-high annual rate last month, the Fed remains unlikely to hike the  federal funds rate in the near future. Many of the factors lifting prices in  recent months, including costly energy and commodities and a weaker U.S.  dollar, have reversed since mid-July. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
