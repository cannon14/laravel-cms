			<p>On Wednesday, the Fed said interest rates will remain at "exceptionally low levels" for "some time." Fed changes to monetary policy alter the fed funds rate and, by extension, the prime rate, to which many credit cards are pegged.</p>
			<p>However, with the fed funds rate already effectively lowered to 0 percent, the Fed outlined other possible strategies to prop up the economy, including the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked.</p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
