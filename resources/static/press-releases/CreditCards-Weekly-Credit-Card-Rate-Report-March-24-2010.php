			<p>Capital One's Visa Business Platinum card's APR changed from  a range (14.99 to 24.99 percent) to a single rate of 19.99 percent. Also, one no  longer available Capital One business card was replaced in our database by another  with a slightly higher APR. </p>
			<p>Capital One didn't respond to requests for comment. Credit  card rates have risen steadily in recent months, due to the troubled economy  and greater regulation from the Credit CARD Act. Although the law restricts lenders'  ability to raise rates on existing cardholders, it allows banks to freely alter  the terms for new cards. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
