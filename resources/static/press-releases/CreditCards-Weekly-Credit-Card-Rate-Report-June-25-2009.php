			<p>The Fed's decision to leave its federal funds rate unchanged  did not surprise analysts, who nevertheless say an economic recovery will  eventually prompt a reversal of current monetary policy initiatives, including  finally boosting the fed funds rate. That would, in turn, lift banks' prime  rate -- which is pegged to the fed funds rate -- and by extension, increase the  APRs for variable rate credit cards tied to prime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their  Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
