			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas &mdash; Interest rates on new credit card offers rebounded this week,  according to the CreditCards.com Weekly Credit Card Rate Report, after U.S.  Bank raised rates on several of its card offers. </p>

The  average is comprised of about 95 of the most popular credit cards in the  country, including cards from dozens of leading U.S. issuers and representing every  card category listed below. Introductory (teaser) rates are not included in the  calculation.

			<p>U.S. Bank boosted APRs on four cards following the recently  implemented Credit CARD Act.
			Although the new law restricts lenders' ability to adjust  current cardholder APRs for risk, it doesn't limit the rates on new card  offers. Since the law's passage, many issuers have chosen to dramatically  increase APRs on new cards.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
