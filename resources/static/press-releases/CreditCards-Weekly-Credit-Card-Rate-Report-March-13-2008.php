			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas - Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories were largely unchanged this week, amid expectations for  a larger Federal Reserve rate cut on March 18 ramped up in the wake of unfavorable  jobs and retail sales data. </p>
			<p>A majority of banks index their credit card APRs to the  prime rate, which moves in lock step with Fed rate moves. According to the Fed,  54 percent of issuers tie card interest rates to prime, with most banks  adjusting variable rates 30 days or one billing cycle after a change in the  prime rate. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>The February employment report, released last Friday, showed  the largest payroll decline in five years. Thursday's retail report was  abysmal, too. Together, they pushed expectations higher that the Fed will cut its  key fed funds rates again on April 30, perhaps by another half-point. The Fed  has cut that rate five times since last September, from 5.5 percent to today's  3 percent. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
