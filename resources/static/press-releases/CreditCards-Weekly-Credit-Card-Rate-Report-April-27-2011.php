			<p>This lack of movement is nothing new. Rates have been largely static
			throughout 2011.</p>
			<p>However, as the chart above shows, the national average APR for
			a new credit card offer is actually slightly lower than it was six
			months ago. That&rsquo;s good news for cardholders, who are heading
			into the summer travel season already wrestling with sky-high prices
			for gas and groceries.</p>
			<p>Cardholders got more good news as the Federal Reserve said today
			it will be leaving the federal funds rate unchanged. That matters
			because when the fed funds rate goes up, the prime rate goes up
			by the same amount. When the prime rate moves, people with variable-rate
			cards &ndash; the vast majority of U.S. cardholders -- see their
			cards&rsquo; APRs increase by the same amount immediately.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
