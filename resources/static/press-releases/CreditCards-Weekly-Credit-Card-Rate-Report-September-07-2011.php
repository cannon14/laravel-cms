			<p>The average annual percentage rate (APR) on new card offers remained
			at 14.94 percent for the second straight week. That's the highest since
			we began tracking rates in 2007. The previous record was 14.91 percent,
			set in July. </p>
			<p>Sporting goods store Cabela's changed the top end of the APR offered
			for Cabela's Club Visa from 18.18 percent to 18.21 percent. However,
			we only use the low end of ranges in our calculations, so the move
			did not affect the national average.</p>
			<p>Cabela's&nbsp;chief financial officer&nbsp;Kevin Werts said the
			change was due to an increase in Libor, the British equivalent of
			the U.S. federal funds rate. When Libor moves, the Cabela&rsquo;s
			card&rsquo;s APR -- and APRs of all cards tied to Libor -- moves
			by the same amount.</p>

			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
