			<p>The national average annual percentage rate (APR) held  steady at 14.95 percent Wednesday for the fifth consecutive week. </p>
			<p>None of the issuers tracked by CreditCards.com altered rates  this week. </p>
			<p>Since Jan. 1, interest rates have remained unchanged nine  weeks out of 12. In the rare instances that the national average did change  this year, it moved by just one hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
			<p>Credit card issuers have been slow to make substantial  changes to card offers for much of the past year. Average credit card interest rates,  for example, have hovered between 14.9 percent and 15.01 percent since March  21, 2012. </p>
			<p>Many of the cards tracked by CreditCards.com have also featured  the same promotional offers since early 2012.</p>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey  (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>)  is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'  websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.
