			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas - Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories were unchanged to lower this week, as the Federal  Reserve's interest rate cuts continued to get passed along to consumers. On the  research front, banks were shown to have increased the proportion of fixed rate  credit card offers in early 2008 to lock in APRs amid expectations of additional  rate cuts. </p>
			<p>Of the nine card categories tracked by CreditCards.com, four  had lower rates, four categories were unchanged and one rose. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>Market research firm Synovate's Mail Monitor study showed  that fixed rate offers climbed to 40 percent of all credit card mail volume in  the first quarter from 22 percent in the year-ago period, even as credit card  mailings declined overall. Meanwhile, the percentage of introductory rates for  purchases or balance transfers rose as banks attempted to encourage card activity. </p>
			<p>The Federal Reserve's G.19 report on consumer credit for  April, scheduled for release next week, will reveal whether issuers' efforts to  stimulate credit card usage were successful. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
