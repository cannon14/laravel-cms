			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas - Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories edged lower this week, as banks appeared to play  catch-up following last week's Federal Reserve rate cut. Following that  decision, a smaller-than-expected decline in April payrolls appeared to support  a pause in the Fed's rate-cutting campaign. </p>
			<p>Still, cardholders need all the rate relief they can get, since  recent reports show that consumers are increasingly relying on their credit  cards even as approval standards for plastic become tougher. </p>
			<p>Of the nine card categories tracked by CreditCards.com, seven  had lower rates, one category rose and one remained unchanged. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>
