			<p>AmEx largely decreased interest rates on new credit card  offers in response to the Federal Reserve rate cut in late October. Banks  generally follow the direction of the federal funds rate, currently at 1  percent, when setting rates on their variable rate credit cards. &nbsp; </p>
			<p>Fed action continues to appear likely. Today, major European  central banks, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England, slashed  their own key rates. Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said in a  speech that, with a &quot;direct path&quot; to economic recovery  &quot;unlikely,&quot; the U.S. central bank still has &quot;a number of options  to help the economy,&quot; including further changes to the fed funds rate.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
