			<p>
			The national average annual  percentage rate (APR) decreased to 14.92 percent Wednesday as a result of a  CreditCards.com database card change.
			<p>
			Chase no longer offers the  University of Florida rewards credit card, so it was replaced with the Frontier  Airlines MasterCard, which has a 15.99-24.99 percent variable APR. This airline  rewards card also offers a 0 percent introductory balance transfer APR to new  cardholders for 15 months.
			</p>
			<p>
			Issuers did not make any other  annual fee or promotional offer changes for the fourth week in a row. The 2014  national average APR holds steady at 15.02 percent.
