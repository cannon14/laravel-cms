			Although recent talk on Wall Street has shifted from discussions of a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve to the timing of potential monetary policy tightening, the latest economic news soothed some concerns. Data showed that May's core producer price index edged up only slightly, suggesting that wholesale price inflation remains tame when volatile food and energy costs are stripped out.
			</p>
			<p>
			Currently, economists foresee the central bank leaving interest rates unchanged for the eighth-straight time when it meets later this month. Any Federal Reserve decision to tighten monetary policy would likely trickle down, resulting in an increase to credit card APRs.

			<p>
