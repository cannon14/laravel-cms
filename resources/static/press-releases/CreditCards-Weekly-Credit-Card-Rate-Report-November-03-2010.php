			<p>The national average reached the highest level since tracking began in
			2007, after the Walmart Discover card&rsquo;s APR changed to 22.90 percent
			for all new cardholders. That card had previously featured a rate range
			of 13.90 percent to 22.90 percent. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>While the card issuer was unavailable for comment, analysts say
			lenders continue to raise APRs amid high unemployment -- which increases
			the likelihood of unpaid bills -- and the Credit CARD Act's restrictions
			on the re-pricing of cards based on increasing risk. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
