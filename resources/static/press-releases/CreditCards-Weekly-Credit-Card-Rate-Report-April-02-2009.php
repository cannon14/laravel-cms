			<p>In a report Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service said the  Fed's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) should have an initially  modest impact on credit markets but will build momentum as it expands to  include more securities. Currently, TALF focuses on securities issued in 2009  that are backed by consumer debt, including credit cards. </p>
			<p>Although Moody's sees credit cards benefiting under TALF,  experts have previously cautioned that banks could remain stingy about lending  amid fears that troubled workers will be unable to repay loans. Jobs data for  March, due out tomorrow, will shed further light on the state of U.S.  employment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
