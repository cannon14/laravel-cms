			<p>None of the cards that CreditCards.com tracks featured rate  changes this week. However, one issuer did make at least one substantial change  to a promotional offer that it uses to lure new customers. </p>
			<p>Pentagon Federal Credit Union canceled its unconventional offer  on the PenFed Platinum Cash Rewards card and replaced it with a more  traditional 0 percent balance transfer offer that lasts for 18 months. </p>
			<p>Previously, new applicants were offered a low 4.99 percent interest  rate on balance transfers for the full life of the balance. The lengthy  promotional rate, which was first introduced in April 2012, was unique in that  it was the only introductory offer tracked by CreditCards.com that didn&rsquo;t have  a time limit.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>)  is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'  websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
