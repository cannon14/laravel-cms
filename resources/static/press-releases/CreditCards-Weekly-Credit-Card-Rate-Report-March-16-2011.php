			<p>Although the national average held steady, one issuer did tweak its rates.
			Discover implemented a higher APR on the top end of the range for its
			Miles by Discover card this week, bumping it up from 15.99 percent to
			16.99 percent.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We do not comment on our rate marketing practices for competitive
			reasons,&rdquo; Discover spokesman Matthew Towson said. </p>
			<p>CreditCards.com adjusted the card&rsquo;s APR in its database.&nbsp; However,
			since only the low ends of APR ranges are used to calculate the
			national average, it remained static. </p>
			<p>The average had fallen in the previous two weeks for the first
			time since mid-November. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
