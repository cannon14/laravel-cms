			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas - While credit card interest rates were flat this week, a drop could follow the Federal Reserve's decision to loosen monetary policy. </p>
			<p>On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to lower the federal funds rate a half point to 4.75 percent, which means the prime rate will also fall a half point to 7.75 percent. </p>
			<p>Most banks base their credit card annual percentage rates (APRs) on an index tied to the prime rate, so a lowering of the prime could result in lessened interest rates for most cardholders. According to the Fed, 54% of credit card issuers tie card interest rates to prime, with most banks adjusting variable rates 30 days or one billing cycle after a change in the prime rate. </p>
			<p>Student credit cards had the steepest APRs. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are listed below:</p>

			<p>When and if individual credit card rates fall depends on a number of factors, such as whether the credit card is fixed rate or variable rate; any floor on rates established by the issuer; and the timing of an APR change as dictated by the card agreement. </p>
