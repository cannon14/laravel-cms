			<p>As banks make it more costly and difficult to use plastic, consumers  have scaled back their credit card debts. Federal Reserve data released Monday  showed that card balances fell in October for a record 13th straight month. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Although banks are raising APRs,  the Federal Reserve appears committed to keeping its key lending rate -- to  which most credit card rates are tied -- at record lows. In a speech earlier  this week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated the central bank's expectation  that inflation will &quot;remain subdued for some time,&quot; allowing it to  keep rates low. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their  Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
