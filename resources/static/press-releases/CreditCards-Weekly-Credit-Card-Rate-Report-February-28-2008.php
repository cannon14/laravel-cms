			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas &ndash; Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories were unchanged to lower this week, as comments from  leading Federal Reserve policymakers suggested additional rate cuts can be  expected when the central bank meets on March 18. </p>
			<p>A majority of banks index their credit card APRs to the  prime rate, which moves in lock step with Fed decisions. According to the Fed,  54 percent of issuers tie card interest rates to prime, with most banks  adjusting variable rates 30 days or one billing cycle after a change in the  prime rate.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>Fed Chief Ben Bernanke noted that &quot;downside risks to  growth remain,&quot; adding that the central bank &quot;will act in a timely  manner as needed.&quot; Bernanke's comments followed similar remarks by Fed  Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who acknowledged higher prices but suggested economic  weakness remains a greater threat than inflation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Seeming to emphasize that reality, the fourth-quarter  gross domestic product edged higher by an unrevised 0.6 percent, reflecting a  sharp economic slowdown. </p>
