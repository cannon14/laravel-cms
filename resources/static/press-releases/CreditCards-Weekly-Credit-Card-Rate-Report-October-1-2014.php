			<p>The national average annual  percentage rate (APR) rose to 15.07 percent Wednesday after falling to 15.05  percent the previous week. The last time average rates were this high was in  January 2012 when the national average hit 15.14 percent.
			<p>This week's rate increase was  spurred by a change to a regional issuer's card offerings. First National Bank  of Omaha is no longer offering the Graphite American Express card. So  CreditCards.com replaced it with another card offered by the same bank, the  First National Bank American Express card.</p>
			<p>Unlike the Graphite card, the  First National Bank American Express card does not carry an annual fee. But it  does have a slightly higher minimum APR of 15.99 percent.</p>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey  (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>) is conducted weekly, using offer data from the  leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory offer periods and regular  interest rates will vary with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based  pricing policies.
