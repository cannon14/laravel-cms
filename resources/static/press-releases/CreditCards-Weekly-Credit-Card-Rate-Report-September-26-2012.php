			<p>None of the cards CreditCards.com tracks featured rate  changes this week. </p>
			<p>Interest rates on new credit card offers have remained  exceptionally stable for the past two years. For example, the average APR on  new card offers for 2012 has hovered around 14.9 percent all year. During the same  period in 2011, average rates were just slightly lower, topping out at 14.79  percent.</p>
			<p>The recent stagnation contrasts sharply to the rapid APR  increases that followed the passage of the Credit CARD Act of 2009. Between  January 2009 and September 2009, average rates stood at 12.19 percent. The  following year, average APRs during the same period climbed to 14.19 percent.</p>
