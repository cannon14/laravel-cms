			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas - Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories largely climbed this week, although rates for bad credit  and student credit cards declined. Minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve  meeting and economic data highlighted an ongoing challenge for Fed  policymakers.</p>
			<p>A majority of banks index their credit card APRs to the  prime rate, which moves in lock step with Fed decisions. According to the Fed, 54  percent of issuers tie card interest rates to prime, with most banks adjusting  variable rates 30 days or one billing cycle after a change in the prime  rate. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>Even after slashing rates to their lowest level since June  2005, the Fed minutes showed the central bank continued to see threats to the  economy. "With no signs of stabilization in the housing sector and with  financial conditions not yet stabilized, the Committee agreed that downside  risks to growth would remain even after this action," the Fed said.</p>
			<p>A rise in January consumer prices highlighted inflationary  pressures. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed reported the third-straight  contraction in that region's manufacturing sector during February, fanning  recessionary fears. </p>
