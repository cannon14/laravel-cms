			<p>As rising job losses make bill payment difficult for credit cardholders,  banks are seeing record levels of delinquencies, or payments made at least 30  days late. Experts say that credit card pricing reflects the uncertainty  surrounding consumers' ability to repay debt.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>On Wednesday, minutes released from the Federal Reserve's policy  meeting in June indicated unemployment remains a challenge. Predicting a  &quot;sluggish&quot; economic recovery, &quot;most participants anticipated  that the employment situation was likely to be downbeat for some time,&quot;  the Fed said. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their  Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
