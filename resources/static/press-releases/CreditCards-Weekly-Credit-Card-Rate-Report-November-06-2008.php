			<p>Citi, Bank of America, Chase and Discover trimmed select  APRs in reaction to the Fed's decision to cut its key lending rate. Although  analysts predict that consumers' rate relief could be limited due to issuer-imposed  &quot;floors&quot; on how low rates fall, Bank of America, which doesn't set  floors, had told CreditCards.com that variable rates based on prime would drop  in the wake of the Fed's move. </p>
			<p>Also, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank  today slashed their respective key lending rates. In the United States, tomorrow's  release of October employment numbers could help determine whether the Fed decides  to cut rates further. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
