			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin,   Texas -- Annual percentage rates  for new credit card offers showed mixed movement this week amid a reshuffling  of card offers, according to the CreditCards.com Weekly Credit Card Rate Report. </p>
			<p>Data shows that a weak job market is having a dampening  effect on inflation, which could allow the Fed to take its time before raising  a key short-term interest rate.  Of the nine credit card categories tracked by CreditCards.com, three advanced,  three declined and three were unchanged. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>The Fed's &quot;beige book&quot; survey of economic conditions  showed that in most areas of the country, worker pay increases were kept  moderate by a &quot;general pullback in hiring.&quot; In addition, revised second-quarter  data showed greater worker productivity despite relatively flat wages, alleviating  pressure on employers to hire more people. </p>
			<p>Amid lessening worries of bigger paychecks spurring  inflation, the Fed is expected to maintain a key short-term interest rate at  its monetary policy meeting on Sept. 16. That would mean an unchanged prime  rate, which banks use to set APRs on variable rate cards. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement  may be influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
