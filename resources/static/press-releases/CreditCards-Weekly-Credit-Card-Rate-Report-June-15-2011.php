			<p>Although the national average held steady at 14.83 percent, one bank
			temporarily stopped marketing a card this week.&nbsp; For the time being,
			Bank of America has removed the NASCAR RacePoints Visa from its website.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re in the process of evaluating potential changes
			to the product features and have temporarily discontinued marketing
			the card to avoid any customer confusion,&quot; spokeswoman for
			Bank of America Betty Riess said.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Bank of America, a leader in sports rewards cards, also markets
			the MLB Extra Bases MasterCard.&nbsp;  For 15 years, BoA offered
			NFL team Visa cards until 2010, when London-based Barclay's won
			the league's business.</p>
			<p>Sports affiliated cards often offer discounts for items on a team&rsquo;s
			online store and, sometimes, tickets to games. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
