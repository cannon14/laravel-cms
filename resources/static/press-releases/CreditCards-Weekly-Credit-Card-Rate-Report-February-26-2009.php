			<p>As Citi adjusts rates upward, the broader U.S. economy  continues to point south. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  acknowledged the economy's &quot;severe contraction,&quot; which the Fed  addressed in December by lowering its key lending rate to nearly zero. Based on  economic conditions, Bernanke said rates will likely remain &quot;exceptionally  low&quot; for &quot;some time.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Although lending rates tend to follow Fed policy, troubled  banks have been slow to loosen borrowing terms for consumers. Nevertheless, Bernanke  reaffirmed the Fed's confidence in initiatives designed to stabilize financial  institutions and markets, improve confidence and help &quot;restore the flow of  credit needed to promote economic recovery.&quot; </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
