			<p>Despite this week's decline, credit card APRs have risen steadily  in the months leading up to the enactment of the Credit CARD Act's major provisions  on Feb. 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CARD Act will limit circumstances under which issuers  can raise rates. With the economy still struggling and hampering cardholders'  ability to pay their debts, card issuers have reacted by locking in rate hikes  while they can. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
