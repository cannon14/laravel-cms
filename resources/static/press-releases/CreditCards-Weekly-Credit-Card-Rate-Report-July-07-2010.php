			<p>The run of increases was the longest since 2007, when rates rose  for seven straight weeks. But an unchanged national average doesn't mean that  issuers weren't making moves. Discover lowered the standard purchase APR for  two cards -- its Escape and Miles cards. Citi raised the lower end of the range  of its Platinum Select MasterCard two percentage points, and Chase changed its  Priority Club Visa from a single 13.24 percent APR to a range of 13.24 percent  to 17.24 percent. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
