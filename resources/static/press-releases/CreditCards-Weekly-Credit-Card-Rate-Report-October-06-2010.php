			<p>The only APR change this week came from Discover, which raised the low
			end of the APR range on its More card from 11.99 percent to 12.99 percent.
			The top end remained at 19.99 percent. Discover didn&rsquo;t respond to
			a request for comment about the move.</p>
			<p>That change pushed the national average slightly higher. It&rsquo;s
			the second straight increase for the national average, following
			last week&rsquo;s jump from 14.14 percent to 14.34 percent. The
			average hadn&rsquo;t increased in consecutive weeks since late June.</p>

			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
