			<p>Recent declines mark the first time since June that the national  average has fallen for two consecutive weeks. However, Bank of America's rate  cuts on two cards during that period only brought the average APR down slightly,  with experts predicting that the longer-term trend will see rates move higher.</p>
			<p>That means cardholders can expect  to pay more to borrow on plastic, as banks raise APRs and reduce access to  credit to guard against losses associated with high unemployment and increasing  regulation.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
