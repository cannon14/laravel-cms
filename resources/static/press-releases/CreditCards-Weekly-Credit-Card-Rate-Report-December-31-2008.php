			<p>Data continue to suggest that Christmas shoppers largely put  away their plastic this year, with a report from a unit of MasterCard indicating  that retail sales fell as much as 4 percent nationwide during the holiday  shopping season. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>That trend is expected to continue. Experts who spoke with  CreditCards.com predict <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/look-ahead-at-2009-credit-cards-1276.php">further  declines in card usage in 2009</a>. Analysts say that credit card payments may  fall as banks tighten lending standards and debt-averse cardholders attempt to  rely less on plastic. Meanwhile, as regulators increase their scrutiny of  punitive interest rate hikes on cardholders, experts say credit card fees could  become a more important source of income for banks, making an increase a  distinct possibility. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
