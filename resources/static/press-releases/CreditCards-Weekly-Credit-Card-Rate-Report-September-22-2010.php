			<p>The latest APR decline follows the readdition to our database of the
			Sony Card, which was reintroduced by Capital One. The low end of the card's
			APR range is below the national average, helping to lower rates overall. </p>
			<p>Any near-term rate movement won't be the result of Federal Reserve
			monetary policy. On Tuesday, the Fed left its key lending rate unchanged,
			with no plans to adjust that rate anytime soon. Nearly all cards
			have variable rates tied to the prime rate, which moves in relation
			to changes in the fed funds rate. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
