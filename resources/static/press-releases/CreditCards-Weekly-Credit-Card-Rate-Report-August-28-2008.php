			<p>On Wednesday, minutes released from the Fed's Aug. 5  meeting showed policy makers' next move could be a rate increase, as some officials  &quot;expressed significant concerns&quot; about the threat posed by inflation.  Still, the size and timing of any rate hike remains unclear, with the Fed expected  to leave a key short-term interest rate unchanged through the end of the year.  That would mean an unchanged prime rate, which banks use to set APRs on  variable rate cards. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the threat of recession appeared to diminish. Second-quarter  gross domestic product data was revised upward to show that the economy grew  faster in the spring than originally estimated. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
