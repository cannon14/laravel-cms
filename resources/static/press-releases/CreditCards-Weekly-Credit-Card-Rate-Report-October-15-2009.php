			<p>APRs were unchanged this week following recent pledges from  Bank of America, Discover and Capital One to not raise interest rates ahead of  the Credit CARD Act, which will make it tougher for banks to hike interest  rates on their customers. However, BofA said it plans to begin charging annual  fees on some of its cards beginning next year. </p>
			<p>The decline in APRs this week stemmed from the addition of credit cards to the CreditCards.com Rate Report database. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their  Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
