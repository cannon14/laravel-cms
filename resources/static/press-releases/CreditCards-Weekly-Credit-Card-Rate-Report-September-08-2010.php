			<p>The NFL card was previously pulled from our database in mid-April before
			the NFL moved its credit card business from Bank of America to Barclays.
			The new NFL card debuted at Barclays in September, with APRs of 13.74
			percent or 17.74 percent, depending on the borrower's credit history. </p>
			<p>When a card offers two APRs, we use the lower rate in our calculations.
			The NFL card's new low rate brought down APRs in the rewards category,
			but wasn't enough of a decrease to impact the national average. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
