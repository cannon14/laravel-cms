			<p>Among their most recent changes to card offers, banks  continue to hike APRs in an effort to protect themselves from losses associated  with high unemployment and increasing regulation. </p>
			<p>Amid double-digit joblessness, the  Federal Reserve on Wednesday again left lending rates at record lows. Economists  say the Fed will leave rates unchanged until unemployment falls. That means  that while the bulk of cards have variable interest rates tied to the prime  rate, any near-term changes to APRs will come from card issuers rather than the  Fed. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit  quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
