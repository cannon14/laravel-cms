			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas &mdash; Annual percentage rates on new credit card offers fell  sharply this week, according to the CreditCards.com Weekly Credit Card Rate  Report, but don't expect your APR to also drop. </p>
			<p>The national average credit card APR is comprised of about 95  of the most popular credit cards in the country, including cards from dozens of  leading U.S.  issuers and representing every card category listed below. This week, it fell  to 12.68 percent due to reconfiguration of card offers in the database rather  than any major moves by issuers. Introductory (teaser) rates are not included  in the calculation. Among the average APRs in nine card categories, three  declined and six were unchanged.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below: </p>

			<p>Banks have been boosting APRs to protect their profits from  cardholder delinquencies spurred by the economic downturn and consumer friendly  legislation set for enactment next year. Additionally, issuers have  increasingly turned to variable rate offers with interest rates that will increase  when the Federal Reserve raises its key lending rate. However, this week, Fed  Chairman Ben Bernanke said a rate hike is unlikely in the near term. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their  Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
