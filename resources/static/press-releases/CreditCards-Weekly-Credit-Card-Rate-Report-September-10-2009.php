			<p>Chase's decision to boost APRs suggests that banks continue to adjust to both ongoing economic challenges and new federal legislation aimed at curbing credit card abuses.</p>
			<p>On the economic front, the Federal Reserve's "beige book" survey of its regional banks showed consumer spending generally remained soft and lending standards remained tight during July and August. That combination helped to drive credit card balances down in July for the 10th straight month, as indicated by the Fed's G.19 report on consumer credit.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
