			<p>Capital One introduced a higher APR version of its Orbitz  Visa Platinum card aimed at borrowers with lower credit scores. The issuer also  lowered rates on its Venture One Rewards Card, which is designed for borrowers  with excellent credit. The changes were in response to the &quot;competitive landscape  and market conditions,&quot; Cap One said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Other issuers also made adjustments. Chase changed its United  Mileage Plus Visa Signature card from a single 13.24 percent rate to a range of  13.24 to 19.24 percent, meaning most cardholders are likely to qualify for  those costlier rates. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' Web sites. Introductory  offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit quality  and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
