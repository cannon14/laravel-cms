			<p>So far, 2011 has been marked by an unusual lack of movement on card offers.
			This week marks the fourth time since the beginning of the year that card
			offers have remained unchanged. None of the card issuers that CreditCards.com
			tracks made APR moves this week, and all but one left promotional offers
			alone as well. </p>
			<p>This year&rsquo;s relative lack of movement on offers for new cardholders
			is a significant departure from most of 2010 when card issuers tested
			offers far more often. Since the beginning of 2011, the national
			average has hovered just above 14.7 percent, and it hasn&rsquo;t
			declined once since the beginning of the year. This year&rsquo;s
			rate increases have also been notably small. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
