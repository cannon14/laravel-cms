			<p>The Fed is expected to trim interest rates by a quarter  percentage point next week, which would amount to the smallest cut so far this  year. However, with some Fed officials worried that further cuts could drive up  inflation, the possibility remains that rates could be left unchanged.</p>
			<p>In the language accompanying its decision, the central  bank may indicate that it plans to take a break after aggressively slashing  interest rates since September of last year. Such a pause could give  policymakers time to determine whether their actions so far are enough to help  boost the economy later this year.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
