			<p>The national average annual percentage rate (APR) rose to 14.99 percent Wednesday after Capital One increased rates on nearly all of its cards.</p>
			<p>The nationwide issuer subtly raised interest rates this week by increasing the APRs on most of its cards by 0.09 percent. For example, the QuicksilverOne card now charges new cardholders an APR of 22.99 percent, up from 22.90 percent. Capital One also increased the Journey Student Rewards cardâ€™s APR from 19.80 percent to 19.99 percent. </p>
			<p>One credit card issuer did make significant changes to the  promotional offer on one of its rewards credit cards. PNC Bank extended the  interest-free period on the PNC Points Visa from six months to 12 months. The  issuer also shortened the card&rsquo;s promotional 0 percent balance transfer offer  from 15 months to 12 months.</p>
			<p>Variable rate cards tied to the U.S. prime rate may also receive a small rate hike this week. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the first time since June 2006. By law, card issuers may pass along these increases without notice.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey  (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>)  is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'  websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
