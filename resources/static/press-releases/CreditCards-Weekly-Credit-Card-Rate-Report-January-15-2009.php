			<p>According to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book economic survey  of its 12 regional banks, many areas of the country reported that credit  conditions &quot;remained tight or tightened further&quot; over a six-week  period through the first week of January. Tough borrowing conditions appeared  to weigh on consumer spending: One Boston-area retailer responding to the  survey noted that the &quot;lack of consumer credit has negatively affected  sales.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Retail sales data further indicated consumers aren't using  plastic. December sales were down a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent from  November and down nearly 10 percent from the year before. That year-over-year  result marked the steepest fall since records began in 1968. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
