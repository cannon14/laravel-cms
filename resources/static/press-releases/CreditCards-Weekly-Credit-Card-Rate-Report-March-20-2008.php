			<p>In the statement accompanying its rate-cut announcement, the  Fed warned that "the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of  the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next  few quarters. "The central bank left the door open to further rate cuts,  saying it will act in a "timely manner as needed."</p>
			<p>Economic news released Thursday was mixed. Business  research group the Conference Board said its indicator of the economy's  expected future performance declined in February for the fifth-consecutive fall,  while new unemployment claims surged last week. However, the Philadelphia Fed's  March index provided a better-than-expected reading on regional manufacturing activity.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
