			<p>Capital One's rate hikes come as the federal government is  working hard to encourage lending. Under the Obama administration and Federal  Reserve's recently unveiled Consumer &amp; Business Lending Initiative, investors  would be lent money in order to buy securities backed by debt, including credit  cards and auto, student and small business loans. Those securities keep credit  flowing by providing banks with the funds necessary to make new loans. </p>
			<p>Credit is needed to drive business growth and consumer  spending. Although data released today showed that retail sales unexpectedly  rose in January, some analysts dismissed the monthly increase as a one-off departure  from an otherwise downward trend.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement  may be influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
