			<p>None of the issuers tracked  by CreditCards.com altered rates this week. Promotional terms, including  introductory APRs and balance transfer offers, also remained unchanged. </p>
			<p>Most issuers tracked by  CreditCards.com have left credit card APRs alone since the beginning of the  year. As a result, the national average annual percentage rate (APR) is lower  now than it's been in years. </p>
			<p>For most of 2014, average  rates hovered just above 15 percent. In early November, the national average  APR slid to 14.98 percent before continuing to periodically decline through the  rest of the year. By Dec. 30, the national average had fallen to a  two-and-a-half year low of 14.91 percent. </p>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey  (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>) is conducted weekly, using offer data from the  leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory offer periods and regular  interest rates will vary with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based  pricing policies.
