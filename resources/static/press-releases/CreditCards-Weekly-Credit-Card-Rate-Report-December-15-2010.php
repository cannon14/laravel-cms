			<p>Chase began offering a rate of 13.24 percent on its Sapphire
			card in addition to its previous 12.24 percent rate. However,
			because CreditCards.com only uses the lowest available
			rate in its calculations, that change had no impact on
			the national average APR. </p>
			<p>This marks the second time in three weeks that the national
			average has been unchanged. The average has not increased
			since early November. </p>
			<p>Also, the Federal Reserve left its lending rate at record
			lows Tuesday, meaning variable APRs -- the rates that apply
			to most U.S. credit cards -- won't rise in response. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted
			weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'
			websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest
			rates will vary with applicants' credit quality and issuer
			risk-based pricing policies. </p>
