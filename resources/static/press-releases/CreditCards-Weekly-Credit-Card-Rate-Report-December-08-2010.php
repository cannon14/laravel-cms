			<p>Capital One switched five cards from single APR to ranges.
			Four of those cards now have a range with a minimum APR
			below the card&rsquo;s previous rate. Since we factor only
			the bottom end of any ranges into our calculations, Cap
			One's adjustments lowered the national average. </p>
			<p>Rates have declined three of the last four weeks, after reaching
			record highs in November. Experts say that credit remains
			difficult to obtain, with credit limits trimmed over recent
			months and projections for a gap between credit demand and
			supply. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted
			weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'
			websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest
			rates will vary with applicants' credit quality and issuer
			risk-based pricing policies. </p>
