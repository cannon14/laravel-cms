			<p>This week marks the second rate increase since 2011 began. </p>
			<p>State Farm made the biggest dent in this week&rsquo;s national
			average, raising the bottom end of the State Farm Student Visa from
			10.24 percent to 11.24 percent. Barclays also contributed to the
			increase by moving the U.S. Airways Premier World MasterCard to
			15.99 percent to 24.99 percent. It had previously featured a 15.24
			percent to 18.24 percent range.</p>
			<p>Citi increased the top end of the Citi Platinum Select card&rsquo;s
			range from 19.99 percent to 20.99 percent. However, because CreditCards.com
			only uses a card&rsquo;s lowest available rate in its calculations,
			the bank&rsquo;s move didn&rsquo;t affect the national average. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
