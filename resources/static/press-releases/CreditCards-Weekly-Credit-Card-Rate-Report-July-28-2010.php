			<p>Chase adjusted its Slate card offer, with the product now charging APRs
			between 13.24 and 22.24 percent, compared with an earlier range between
			11.24 and 22.24 percent. Since the national average is calculated using
			the low end of any APR ranges, that change caused rates overall to move
			higher. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>In an effort to protect themselves from potential losses, banks
			have raised interest rates over recent months. Recent earnings reports
			from major card issuers, however, show that delinquencies -- or
			unpaid bills -- declined in the second quarter, according to data
			from the American Bankers Association. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
