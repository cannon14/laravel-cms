			<p>For six of the first 12 weeks this year, the national average stayed
			fixed.&nbsp; In 2010, the national average was unchanged only 11 times
			throughout the entire year. </p>
			<p>Card issuers are still tweaking rates and offers, however. For
			example, Citi recently began offering multiple APRs for its Forward
			card, varying between a single rate of 14.24 percent to a range
			of 12.99 percent to 19.99 percent.&nbsp; Since only the low ends
			of the ranges are included in our calculations, Citi's move did
			not impact the national average.</p>
			<p>Offers can vary based on many factors, including when and where
			the banks' sites are viewed.</p>
			<p>These differences are often considerable and drive home the importance
			of consumers shopping around for the best deals. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
