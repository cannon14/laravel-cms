			<p>Several factors may have contributed to this record-breaking anomaly,
			experts say. Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said card
			issuers have begun to understand how to achieve and maintain profits despite
			the Credit CARD Act of 2009, legislation that rattled the industry.</p>
			<p>That understanding has created more certainty in the credit card
			business and limited the need for experimentation, she said. </p>
			<p>Further signs of a strengthening economy, coupled with fewer credit
			card defaults, have also created a greater sense of stability. </p>
			<p>&quot;For now, card issuers have seen defaults abate and are taking
			advantage of a moment of clarity,&quot;  Swonk said, &quot;even
			if it is not the world that they would like to envision.&quot;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
