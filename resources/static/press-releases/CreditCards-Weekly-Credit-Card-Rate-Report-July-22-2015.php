				<p>For the fifth week in a row, the national average APR remained at 15 percent. None of the cards tracked by CreditCards.com advertised new rates. Promotional offers, including interest-free balance transfer offers and introductory purchase rates, were also left in place. </p>
				<p>For the second time this year, Capital One eliminated the $19 annual fee on its Platinum card. The issuer had removed the cardâ€™s annual fee in January, but then reintroduced it in March. </p>
				<p>Earlier this year, Capital One also eliminated the $29 annual fee on the Secured MasterCard. As a result, the QuicksilverOne card, the Classic Platinum card and the Venture Rewards card are currently the only personal cards that Capital One offers that carry an annual fee.</p>
