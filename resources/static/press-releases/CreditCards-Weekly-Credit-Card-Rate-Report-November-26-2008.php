			<p>Card issuers may not stand pat on APRs for long, though. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower its key lending rate by half a percentage point in December, with some analysts calling for an additional cut to zero in early 2009.  Banks generally follow the direction of the federal funds rate, currently at 1 percent, when setting rates on their variable rate credit cards.</p>
			<p>Recent economic data makes action by the Fed look increasingly likely. Revised gross domestic product data released this week showed a 0.5 percent decline in the third quarter, with a larger drop predicted for the fourth quarter. Potentially weighing on that growth, consumer spending fell 1 percent in October.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
