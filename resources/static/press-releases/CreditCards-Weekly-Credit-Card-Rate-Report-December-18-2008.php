			<p>On Tuesday, the Fed cut the target for its federal funds  rate to a range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in history. That  decision means the Fed requires fresh strategies as it works to revitalize the  slowing economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>While the rate's drop and the corresponding decline in  banks' prime rates would normally lower variable rates on credit cards tied to  prime, analysts view the latest Fed decision as a largely symbolic move unlikely  to impact cardholders' borrowing costs. Many variable rate cards have already  hit issuer-imposed &quot;floors&quot; beyond which they will not fall. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
