			<p>Austin, Texas - Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories dipped lower this week, after the Federal Reserve left  interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since last summer. </p>
			<p>According to the Fed, 57 percent of banks index their  credit card APRs to the prime rate, with most adjusting variable rates 30 days  or one billing cycle after the prime rate changes. With no change to prime,  banks can leave credit card rates alone. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>The Fed held interest rates at 2 percent but emphasized higher  prices, saying, "Upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have  increased." The central bank must weigh rising inflation against the need  for economic growth, with the latest gross domestic product data showing the  economy expanded more than previously thought in the first quarter. </p>
			<p>Based on its language, the Fed's next decision on Aug. 5 remains  uncertain. "The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial  developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and  price stability," it said.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may also  have been influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
