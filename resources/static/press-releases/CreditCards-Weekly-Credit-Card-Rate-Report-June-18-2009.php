			<p>With the bulk of credit cards having variable rates pegged  to the prime rate -- which itself is tied to the federal funds rate set by the  Federal Reserve -- APRs will likely rise when the Fed eventually hikes interest  rates. However, the Fed will likely keep its lending rate unchanged at the  conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The Fed uses rate hikes to limit  inflation, but consumer price data for May showed poor demand is already  achieving that goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their  Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
