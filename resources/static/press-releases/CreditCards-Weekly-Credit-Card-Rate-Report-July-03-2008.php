			<p>Austin, Texas -- Annual percentage rates for select major  credit card categories were mostly flat to down this week, amid continued employment  weakness. Meanwhile, a European Central Bank decision could put added pressure  on the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.</p>
			<p>According to the Fed, 57 percent of banks index their  credit card APRs to the prime rate, with most adjusting variable rates 30 days  or one billing cycle after the prime rate changes. </p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below:</p>

			<p>June employment data showed payrolls fell by 62,000, for  the sixth-consecutive jobs contraction. Recent reports have indicated that trouble  in the job market is partially to blame for rising credit card delinquencies,  as consumers struggle to repay their debts. </p>
			<p>Overseas, the ECB raised interest rates by a quarter of a  percentage point to 4.25 percent in an effort to combat inflation expectations.  Although the ECB did not suggest a further rate hike was imminent, analysts  have cautioned that higher European rates could weaken the dollar and further boost  oil prices -- potentially causing added inflationary pressure.</p>
