			<p>Although most banks left interest rates alone over the holiday weekend,
			Barclays opened the year with two significant rate changes. The bank raised
			the rates for its U.S. Airways Premier World MasterCard from a range of
			15.24 percent to 18.24 percent to a range of 15.99 percent to 24.99 percent.
			The bank also increased the APR for its upscale Visa Black Card for the
			first time in a year, bumping the rate up from a flat 13.24 percent to
			14.99 percent. </p>
			<p>Barclays confirmed the changes, but did not offer a comment.</p>

			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
