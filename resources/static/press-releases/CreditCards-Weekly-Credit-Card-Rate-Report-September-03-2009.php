			<p>Banks remain uncertain about how they should react to the Credit CARD Act, experts say, leading to a variety of changes for cardholders. After a period of rising interest rates, cardholders may now find other perks being scaled back.</p>
			<p>In the near term, any additional APR changes are unlikely to stem from Federal Reserve monetary policy adjustments. Based on minutes from the Fed's most recent meeting, policymakers appear content to leave the key lending rate at historically low levels for the time being.</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
