			<p>The national average annual percentage rate (APR) rose to  14.98 percent Wednesday after Chase increased the lowest available APR on the  Chase Freedom card by 3 percentage points.</p>
			<p>The Chase Freedom card previously featured a range of  possible APRs, starting at 13.99 percent and topping out at 22.99 percent. It  now features just one flat rate of 16.99 percent.</p>
			<p>The national average was also impacted this week by a  reshuffling of the CreditCards.com database. Occasionally, CreditCards.com  updates the database in order to more accurately reflect the current market.</p>
			<p>This week, CreditCards.com updated the categories for  several cards, causing the average APRs for those categories to change. We also  replaced a discontinued card for sporting enthusiasts with a similar card that  featured a slightly higher APR.</p>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey  (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>)  is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers'  websites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.
