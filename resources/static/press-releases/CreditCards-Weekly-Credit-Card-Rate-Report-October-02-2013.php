			<p>The national average annual percentage rate (APR) remained  unchanged Wednesday after rising the previous week to 15.02 percent. Last week  was the first time all year that the average rate rose above 15 percent.</p>
			<p>This week, Barclays floated a higher offer on the NFL  ExtraPoints card. However, the 14.99 percent APR didn't affect the national  average because the card's lower rate of 13.74 percent is still available to  some applicants. Card issuers frequently test new offers by temporarily  offering alternative rates.</p>
			<p>Pentagon Federal Credit Union also edited terms this week.  The credit union added a $25 annual fee to the PenFed Platinum Cash Rewards  Visa. For a limited time, applicants may qualify for the card's fee-free Plus  version if they apply for an additional financial product.</p>
			The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey  (permalink: <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report">http://www.creditcards.com/rate-report</a>)  is conducted weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites.  Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.
