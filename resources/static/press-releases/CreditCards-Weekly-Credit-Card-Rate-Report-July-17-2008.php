			<p>Acknowledging the "numerous difficulties" facing  the U.S. economy during his semi-annual testimony to congress, Fed Chairman Ben  Bernanke also labeled inflation "too high." That assessment followed  data showing last month's consumer inflation rose at the quickest monthly pace  since June 1982. </p>
			<p>Separately, minutes from the Fed's most recent meeting  also revealed inflationary concerns, with officials suggesting their next move  "could well be an increase in the funds rate." However, as the  outlook for growth and inflation "remained very uncertain," most Fed  official believed "the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was  quite unclear." </p>
