			<p>Although banks remained quiet this week, the Federal Reserve  made some news. On Wednesday, the Fed's Beige Book survey of its regional banks  indicated that despite some modest improvement in economic conditions, banks  reported that credit standards remained tight. </p>
			<p>Meanwhile, in his Thursday confirmation  hearing, Fed chief Ben Bernanke estimated that the central bank's Term  Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility program has so far helped finance more  than 100 million credit card accounts. The TALF program aimed to encourage  lending by providing banks with cheaper financing for card debt. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly, using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers as found on their  Web sites. Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with  applicants' credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
