			<p>The national average APR currently sits at the lowest point since mid-May.
			Despite the recent downturn, rates remain above their levels of six months
			ago and the start of this year, when the average APR stood at 12.97 percent. </p>
			<p>That long-term rate increase appears to be helping discourage card
			use, as Federal Reserve data shows that credit card debt levels
			are falling. Some of that pullback is due to decreased card use,
			some to banks charging off uncollectable debt and closing accounts. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted weekly,
			using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers' websites. Introductory
			offer periods and regular interest rates will vary with applicants'
			credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies. </p>
