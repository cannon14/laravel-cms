			<h1>CreditCards.com: Weekly Credit Card Rate Report</h1>

			<p>Austin, Texas -- Annual percentage rates for new credit  card offers moved all over the place this week, as several banks changed APRs, according  to the CreditCards.com Weekly Credit Card Rate Report. </p>
			<p>Credit card issuers tweaked their offers amid ongoing  economic weakness, though a recent easing of inflation suggests to analysts  that the Federal Reserve will leave a key short-term interest rate unchanged  when it meets on Sept. 16. Of the nine credit card categories tracked by  CreditCards.com, four declined, three rose and two were unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Rates for card categories tracked by CreditCards.com are  listed below: </p>

			<p>Just a few months ago, rising oil prices and inflation  worries had some analysts predicting the Fed would soon boost a key short-term  interest rate. However, the outlook has recently changed. Continuing economic  troubles and easing inflation mean the Fed's benchmark interest rate may hold  steady into 2009. That would leave an unchanged prime rate, which banks use to  set APRs on variable rate cards.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Further confirmation of the economy's weakness came  Friday, as unemployment topped 6 percent for August, the highest jobless rate  in nearly five years. </p>
			<p>The CreditCards.com credit card rate survey is conducted  weekly using offer data from the leading U.S. card issuers. Rate movement may be  influenced by changes in the composition of offers tracked. </p>
			<p>Introductory offer periods and regular interest rates vary  with applicants&rsquo; credit quality and issuer risk-based pricing policies.</p>
