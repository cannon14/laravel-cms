				<strong>We may change the APRs, fees, and other terms of your account at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Account Agreement, which we will send you when your account is opened. Factors we may consider in determining whether and how to change your terms include the frequency and severity of defaults and other indications of overall credit risk.</strong><br>

				<strong>*APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers:</strong> Your APRs for Purchases and Balance Transfers (and the margins added to the Prime Rate to determine these APRs) will depend on Washington Mutual's evaluation of your application and credit history. The Promotional APR for Balance Transfers above applies to balance transfers requested within the first 90 days of account opening. After that, balance transfers will be available only through special offers. Your eligibility for these offers will depend on your credit profile. We will disclose the terms of any future special balance transfer offer when the offer is made.<br>

				<strong>&dagger;Default APR:</strong> Each time you default on this or any Washington Mutual credit card account because you fail to make at least the minimum payment when due, exceed your credit line, or make a payment to us that is not honored by your bank, we may increase the APRs on your account up to a maximum of the Default APR. Factors considered in determining whether and by how much to increase your APRs include the frequency and severity of defaults and other indications of account usage and overall credit risk.<br>

				<strong>&dagger;Prime Rate:</strong> The Prime Rate used to determine your APRs is the highest Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the first business day following the 22nd day of the calendar month before the month in which the billing cycle began. Variable rates are current as of September 2007.<br>

				<strong>&sect;Purchases of Cash Equivalents:</strong> Charges for the purchases of cash equivalents such as money orders, traveler's checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, and the like are treated as Cash Advances and are subject to the Cash Advance fee described above.<br>

				<strong>Cash line:</strong> The amount available for cash advances will be at least 20% of your total credit line and will be shown on your statement.<br>

				<strong>How payments are applied:</strong> Payments will be applied first to finance charges and fees, then to Balance Categories (including new transactions) in the order of the lowest APR to the highest APR. This means that balances subject to promotional or introductory APRs will be paid before balances subject to higher APRs. If the Purchase Balance and another Balance Category have the same APR, payments will generally be applied first to Purchases.<br>

				<strong>ESPN Total Access Rewards Program:</strong> You may generate 5 Points for each $1 of net new purchases you make on select ESPN products and services and 1 Point for each $1 of other net new purchases you make using your credit card account. Cash advances, balance transfers, and transactions using convenience checks will not generate Points. You may generate a maximum of 500,000 Points in any 12 consecutive billing cycles. Points will expire if your credit card account is closed or if you do not use your account to generate Points for 35 consecutive billing periods. You will be able to redeem Points for rewards as ESPN may specify from time to time in the Program Terms and Conditions. Reward levels: 2,500 to 750,000 Points. The terms of the Program (including available rewards) may change. ESPN will mail the complete Program Terms and Conditions to you after you become a cardholder.

			<h2>Application Terms and Conditions</h2>

			<p>
				<strong>By submitting your application</strong>, you acknowledge and agree that: (1) you are at least 18 years old; (2) all information you provide is accurate and complete; (3) your account will be used only for personal, family, or household purposes; (4) we may check your credit and the information you provide; (5) we reserve the right to change the terms of your account; (6) we may request credit reports in connection with this application and to review your account; and (7) we may call you at any number you provide or at any number at which we reasonably believe we can contact you, including calls to mobile, cellular, or similar devices, for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to, suspected fraud or identity theft, obtaining necessary information, your account transactions or servicing, or collecting on your account. Numbers you provide include numbers you give us and/or numbers from which you call us. 
				Upon request, we will tell you if we obtained credit reports and the name and address of any consumer reporting agencies that provided the reports. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. When you use the account, you agree to be bound by the Account Agreement. <strong>The Account Agreement provides that disputes relating to the account are subject to binding arbitration (the "Arbitration Provision"). You may opt out of the Arbitration Provision within 45 days of the date your account is opened by following the instructions included in the Account Agreement.</strong> There are additional terms describing the features and benefits, which will be sent to you when you become a cardholder. A married applicant may apply for credit in his or her own name. An account may not be available to you if you already have a credit account with us or have applied in the last 90 days.<br>

				Second card information: We may provide information about this account to consumer reporting agencies or other agencies in the second cardholder’s name. This is not a joint account. If you allow the second cardholder to use your account, you will be liable for all their transactions. <br>

				<strong>Credit score access:</strong> FICO&reg; credit score availability for new accounts can take up to 90 days from account opening. Scores are generally updated on a monthly basis depending on credit bureau updates and account standing. FICO credit scores are only available online. FICO&reg; is a registered trademark of Fair Isaac Corporation.<br>

				<strong>Important information about procedures for opening a new account:</strong> To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money-laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you.<br>

				<strong>WI Residents:</strong> No provision of a marital property agreement, a unilateral statement, or a court decree adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement, or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision when the obligation to the creditor is incurred. Married applicants must furnish the applicant’s Social Security number and the name and address of their spouse to Card Services at P.O. Box 660509, Dallas, TX 75266-0509 within 15 days from the date you respond to this offer.
