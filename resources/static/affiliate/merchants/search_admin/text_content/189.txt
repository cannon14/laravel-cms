then you might want to consider credit card debt consolidation. A credit
card debt consolidation loan can help you consolidate the outstanding
balances on your credit cards into one loan or onto one credit card that
has a lower interest rate than the ones you are currently paying. If you
are paying high interest rates on your current credit cards then it might
be wise to do a balance transfer onto another credit card or cards that
have a low interest rate. See also Balance Transfer Credit Cards .  Here is an example of how consolidating your credit card debt could be
beneficial. Let's say you have $10,000 in outstanding credit card debt and
the average annual percentage rate APR on that card or cards is 20%. If the
outstanding balance remains at $10,000 then over the course of a year you
would pay approximately $2000 in interest charges alone. If you
consolidated your credit card debt into a single loan with a lower
interest rate or if you did a balance transfer onto a credit card or cards
with a low interest rate you would save a significant amount of money. If
the new loan or credit card had a 10% APR then you would save roughly
$1000 in interest charges over the course of that same year. The best
solution to credit card debt is usually paying off the debt as soon as
possible. If you consolidate your credit card debt or do a balance
transfer onto a low interest 0% balance transfer credit card , this can
reduce your interest expense and help you pay off your debt sooner.  Credit card debt of any sort should be taken seriously. If you have
significant credit card debt you may want to seek individual, professional
financial counseling. For other credit and credit card related articles,
