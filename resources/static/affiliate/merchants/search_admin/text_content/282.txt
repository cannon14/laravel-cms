Use Low APR Credit Cards To Become Debt Free Are you in credit card debt
and perpetually stuck in a cycle struggling to make minimum payments on
your outstanding credit card balance? You can take some degree of comfort
in the fact that you're not alone. Nearly 70% of Americans revolve a
balance on at least one credit card and 45% of those with credit card debt
only make minimum payments on their account each month. Credit card
balances can literally take decades to pay down when only making the
minimum payments.  It may seem unusual to think about credit cards being used as a tool to
become debt free but it's all in how you play your cards. The extremely
competitive nature of the credit card industry has given rise to the low
interest introductory rate and even the 0% intro rate. Low Interest Credit
Cards are not inherently evil, but if used irresponsibly can lead to
tremendous financial hardship. Self discipline is the key – first by
living within your means and, when in debt, developing a plan to get debt
free. Finding a low APR credit card could be important to giving yourself
breathing room if you have existing credit card balances revolving on
other high interest rate credit cards. Once you are approved for a low APR
credit card you can usually transfer balances and begin saving right away.
The difference in monthly outgo for a $9,000 balance at 19.99% APR vs. a
1.9% introductory APR for example would be over $1,600. And this is where
the discipline comes in – it is imperative that you don't use the slack
created by your new low APR credit card to get into more financial trouble
by piling onto your existing debt or spending the savings somewhere else.
Begin paying down the principal with the money you were spending on
interest and that debt will begin to slowly but surely disappear.  A low APR credit card is not the only answer – to truly get out of debt and
stay debt free requires that you cut all unnecessary expenses and live
within a reasonable budget – could be a great first step. Want to know
