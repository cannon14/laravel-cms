Universal Default � What it is and How to Avoid It Universal default is a
relatively new provision that has been added to the card member terms and
conditions by credit card companies. Universal default basically allows
creditors to review a customer�s credit report on a regular basis, and if
there is any change that has negatively impacted their credit score a new,
higher interest rate can be applied.  The customer behaviors that can potentially trigger universal default
pricing by a credit card issuer include the following: Being late even
once on a credit card, mortgage, utility or car payment Going over the
credit limit on any credit card Carrying too much debt overall Using over
50% of the credit line for an individual credit card Having too much
available credit and open trade lines Making too many credit inquiries
Getting a new mortgage or car loan Universal default is not meant to hurt
consumers. Rather, it is intended to protect credit card companies from
potential losses by charging higher interest to those customers with
degrading risk profiles. It is somewhat analogous to a health insurance
company charging higher insurance premiums to someone who smokes, even
though they haven�t filed a claim.  The best way to deal with this new provision is to simply not have it apply
to you. The best rule of thumb is to always, always pay your bills on time.
That includes your utility and magazine subscription bills. Almost any
company that bills for services can report your payment behavior to credit
bureaus, who in turn sell this information to lenders. Even if you haven�t
become a true credit risk, irresponsible behavior can create the
perception of increased risk propensity. Probably the safest course to
take is to stay out of debt . By employing fiscal discipline, you can
simply not care about silly things like interest rates. If you are not
able to do this because of outstanding balances that are priced at high
APRs, you may want to consider a balance transfer to a 0% APR credit card
. That way, you can start aggressively paying down the balance and become
debt free much faster, without having interest charges drag down your
finances. Approximately 45% of credit card issuers have universal default
provisions contained within their cardmember agreements. It is important
for consumers to understand these types of potential costs by reviewing
the terms and conditions beyond the introductory APR prior to applying for
a card. And while these policies probably won't go away, it's important to
realize that banks are just businesses that are taking steps to protect
their bottom line and shareholders. Rather than having these types of
charges apply to you, simply exercise a little caution and discipline to
enjoy the benefits of credit cards without the pitfalls.  For more information on credit cards or related topics please see our
