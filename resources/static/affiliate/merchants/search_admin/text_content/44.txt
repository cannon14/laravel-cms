all credit cards are equal so when you compare credit card offers it can
be challenging. Additionally, what is best for one person may not be best
for another. When considering which credit card is best for you consider
and look at several factors, such as: the introductory APR, the fixed
interest rate, annual fees, rewards programs, member benefits, and other
card member services.  If you are the type of person that pays their entire credit card balance
each month on time then a low interest rate credit card is not as
important as one with no annual fees or great credit card benefits.
However, most people are not that disciplined about paying off their
credit cards in full and on time every month. If you are occasionally late
and carry a balance on your credit cards then a low interest credit card
might be right for you. The difference between a low 10% APR credit card
interest rate and a higher 20% APR credit card interest rate is
significant over time. In addition to low interest rates and the annual
fees you pay on a credit card, you should also consider other member
benefits, such as rewards programs and cash back programs. Some credit
cards offer programs that reward you for using their credit card for
purchases. Frequent flyer programs are an example.  Cash back credit cards actually give you cash back or credit toward
additional purchases. You receive a small percentage of cash back for the
purchases you make with that card. Credit cards that offer cash back
programs are the Chase Cash Plus Rewards Visa Card and the Citi Dividend
Platinum Select Credit Card . Other things to consider when you compare
credit cards are: membership benefits such as travel insurance and baggage
protection while traveling. type of credit needed for approval online
account access and bill payment services unauthorized spending protection
When determining what the best credit card is for you consider the
interest rate, the annual fees, the programs offered and the member
benefits. For other credit and credit card related articles, please visit
