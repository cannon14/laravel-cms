When Picking a New Credit Card – Look for an Orchard Individuals with less
than perfect credit, or those with no credit history know the drill. Apply
for a credit card online that features great rates and rewards, wait a few
weeks and then be told that their credit is not good enough to qualify.
Now, that can be quite frustrating to be told you have bad credit and
don't qualify. Especially when the credit card issuers keep sending out
tantalizing offers in the mail and running ads on television.  There are options for those wishing to establish or rebuild credit,
however. Finally, there is a credit card that offers a reasonable interest
rate with low fees and is specifically designed for those with less than
pristine credit. It's the Orchard Bank MasterCard issued by HSBC! The
Orchard Bank MasterCard features a very respectable 15.9% regular APR and
initial credit lines up to $1,500. Of particular value is the fact that
the Orchard Bank MasterCard reports cardmember repayment behavior to all
three major U.S. credit bureaus. Other payment card options for bad credit
do not typically allow customers to rebuild their credit history. This is a
critical step in creating a solid repayment record that opens new doors for
low cost credit in the future.  With relaxed credit underwriting criteria, applicants are much more likely
to be approved. And, getting approved is the name of the game when bad
credit is in your history. Once approved, it's just a matter of staying
disciplined and making on-time payments to begin building a solid credit
record. It's usually best to pay as you go with credit cards and living
within your means. But, as we all know, that's not always possible for
those of us who are struggling to keep our financial heads above water.
And that's where the 15.9% interest rate can help you pay outstanding
balances over time without taking too much of a toll on your finances.
Other benefits of the Orchard Bank MasterCard include worldwide acceptance
at over 22 million locations and cash access at over 770,000
MasterCard/Cirrus locations around the globe. And, online shopping can be
accomplished with peace of mind because the Orchard Bank Card provides
complete protection from unauthorized purchases. So, maybe it's time to
finally get your credit back on track. Or, if you are just starting out it
could be a great time to start building a good credit rating. Having a
MasterCard credit card is essential in today's world if you want to make a
hotel reservation, rent a car or book an airline flight. And with the
Orchard Bank MasterCard , your chances of getting approved are better than
ever.  For more information on credit cards or related topics, please see our
