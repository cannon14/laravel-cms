it's really free! Unlike many offers you see on the internet for Free
Credit Reports this report does not require joining any credit monitoring
services. Those offers usually involve a free trial period with a paid
credit monitoring membership, rather than a free credit report. Just
recently, the federal government mandated that the three major credit
reporting agencies must provide U.S. citizens with a free annual credit
report.  This central site allows you to request a free credit report once every 12
months from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies:
Equifax , Experian and TransUnion . There are three ways you can request a
Free Credit Report:  1. Request your Credit Report Online - Click to view and print your report
online 2. Request your Credit Report by Phone Call 1-877-322-8228 to
request your credit reports by phone. You will go through a simple
verification process over the phone. Your reports will be mailed to you.
3. Request your Credit Report by Mail You can request your credit report
by mail by filling out the request form and mailing it to: Annual Credit
Report Request Service P.O. Box 105281 Atlanta, GA 30348-5281 You must

they interfere with your credit transactions. Make sure your credit report
is accurate before critical life events occur – when you apply for a
mortgage, change jobs, or get married. Find out why you've been granted or
denied credit. The information you'll see on your report helps lenders make
credit-granting decisions about you. Review your report carefully —
unfamiliar accounts or addresses may indicate possible fraud. See who has
looked at your report recently — creditors, landlords, employers?  Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy |  About Us | Contact Us | Home Page | Site Map Copyright 2006 Credit
