the Dividend Platinum for Size In yet another pro-consumer move, Citibank
has announced a new concept in credit card shopping. The nation�s largest
bank is now allowing consumers to test drive the Citi Dividend Platinum
Select MasterCard with no obligation for a full 90 days.  How does this work? According to Citibank, approved credit card applicants
can use and enjoy the Dividend Platinum Select Card for 90 days and if
they are not happy with the superior cash back rewards or any other
features of the card they can cancel and still receive whatever rewards
they�ve earned during that period. Normally, credit card issuers require
their card members to reach a pre-determined threshold of cash back or
points earnings before rewards can be redeemed. The Citibank offer is
literally unprecedented in the marketplace today. The Citi Dividend
Platinum Select Card features a full 5% cash back reward offer on
purchases at supermarkets, drugstores and gas stations and a full 1% on
all other purchases. Other features include 0% APR for 12 months on
balance transfers and no annual fee.  So, if you are interested in trying out one of the more popular reward
credit card products on a probationary basis, the Citi Dividend Card might
just be the ticket. And, if you aren't completely happy with the cash back
performance of the Citi Dividend Select MasterCard, Citi will cancel the
card and let you keep whatever earnings you have accumulated during the 90
day trial period. Now, that�s a risk-free offer if there ever was one. For
