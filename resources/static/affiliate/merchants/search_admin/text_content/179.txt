Small Business You ve finally followed your dreams of opening your own
small business. You know you have the skills, desire, and ambition to make
your business work, but what you don t have is a corporate credit card .
What s worse, you don t know what type of credit card you should get for
your business.  Choosing the right type of credit card for your business is very important.
The last thing you want to happen is to have your business generating money
solely to pay off your credit card debt. Even worse, you certainly don t
want to have to close your business because of outstanding debt. Instead
of seeing credit as a problem for your business, view it as a useful tool
in helping you achieve success. Extending Cash Flow For businesses that
rely on consistent cash flow to pay for supplies or contactors such as
landscapers, hair salons, interior designers , a credit card that can aid
in purchasing items from clients before invoicing customers is ideal. For
example, a landscaper may use a credit card at the beginning of the month
to buy materials from a wholesale nursery and then pay it off when the
statement comes, after the customer has paid. This way, money paid out
does not need to come out of the landscaper s cash accounts. If your
business falls under this situation, you should look for a credit card
with high limits and benefits for paying off within 30 days. If your
billing cycle to customers goes longer than 30 days, look for a low
interest credit card so it won t matter if you carry a balance for a month
or two.  Business Travel & Entertaining Businesses that require frequent travel
and/or client entertaining should look at promotional cards that offer
bonus benefits. For example, airline frequent flyer cards offer benefits
both for making charges to their cards and for flying their airlines.
Consult with your accountant on how these benefits can be used for either
business or personal use. Another option is to look for a credit card with
no spending limit, such as an American Express card . For professionals who
travel and entertain frequently, carrying this type of card is a way of
ensuring that you can cover all business costs. However, these cards do
charge annual fees and need to be paid off at the end of the billing
cycle. If cash flow does not allow payment in full, then a card with a
high limit that allows you to carry a balance may be a better fit.
Periodical Expenses If you are the type of business that works primarily
on a cash basis or that doesn t need to purchase inventory on a regular
basis then a credit card for periodic or emergency uses would be best.
Look for a small business credit card that offers a moderate credit limit
with a low annual percentage rate APR . This way, if extra money is
needed, it is available for your business and can be paid out over time.  How your business chooses to use credit needs to be discussed between you
and your financial advisor or accountant. Making the right choice when it
comes to corporate credit can help make your business more of a success.
