on the forefront of the reward credit card boom which started with the
America Airlines AAdvantage program. This program was quickly followed by
the United Airlines Mileage Plus program . It was a novel concept to earn
miles for charging everyday expenses with a credit card. And what an
incentive for card loyalty and use � a free roundtrip airline ticket after
a year or two of participation.  With most airlines participating in co-branded credit card programs in
partnership with major issuing banks, the availability of programs for
consumers can seem daunting. Originally it was only the top few air
carriers, like American Airlines and United Airlines. But now, every
carrier seems to have a frequent flyer credit card program. Since airline
credit cards have become something of a commodity with increased
competition among carriers, consumers are the ultimate beneficiaries.
Annual fees have remained low and many bank issuers have waived the fee
for the first year. But the most exciting enticement that has come along
is the up front mileage bonus offered by most airline cards. Leading the
pack is the United Airlines Mileage Plus Signature Visa Card with an
eye-popping 17,500 miles. That�s puts a new cardmember more than halfway
to earning a free ticket with their first purchase!  Several other airline credit card programs come close, like the American
Airlines AAdvantage World MasterCard and Gold Delta Skymiles Card from
American Express, which offer 15,000 mile bonuses to new cardmembers. With
most airline frequent flyer programs the first free ticket earning
threshold is around 25,000 miles, so these programs also move cardmembers
past the halfway mark. So, should the mileage bonus be the determining
factor in choosing a new airline credit card? It can be a big part of the
decision, but more importantly are other primary factors that must be
considered. Things like, which airlines provide service to your city and
cities to which you need or want to fly? And, is there a certain airline
that you really like more than others? If you don't have allegiance to one
particular airline you may want to consider a generic airline credit card
offered by many of the major card issuers. Credit cards like the Chase
Value Miles Card or The Miles Card by Discover Card are excellent examples
that provide an upfront mileage bonus along with the ability to use free
tickets to fly on any major airline.  Credit card customers can really get a big bang for their buck these days
if free air travel is their favorite reward incentive. And with such a big
head start provided by air carriers like United Airlines and American
Airlines, the sky seems to be the limit on incentive miles. Want to know
