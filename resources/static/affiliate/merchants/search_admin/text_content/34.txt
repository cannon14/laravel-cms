Credit Card Today, everyone has a credit card. From teenagers to corporate
professionals to retirees, everyone is enjoying the ease and benefit of
carrying credit cards. However, before applying for a credit card, there
are several factors to consider when deciding what credit card is best for
you. Credit Cards &ndash; Many Shapes and Sizes Believe it or not, there is
a perfect credit card program out there for anyone. Which of these programs
is right for you will depend on several factors, such as:  Age Credit ranking rating Spending needs how much money you need Payment
structures how you will pay it back Special interests Number of current
credit cards Income how much money you make Credit cards are also issued
through numerous financial groups and organizations. For example, it s not
only banks such as Bank America or Citi that offer credit cards to their
members. Specialty financial organizations such as American Express
Financial Group&mdash;who offers the American Express card&mdash;and
Novus&mdash;who offers the Discover Card &mdash;do as well. The only
difference is some organizations may be more competitive about interest
rates and qualifications than others.  Which Card is Right for Me? Before applying for a credit card ask yourself
these questions: Why do you want/need a credit card? &ndash; Maybe you
need one credit card with a special interest rate to transfer balances
from multiple accounts or perhaps you need a card specifically for
business purposes. How much do you need to charge at one time? &ndash; If
the credit card is for business purposes, maybe you need a card with very
high or no spending limits. On the other hand, if this is your first card
and you are trying to build credit or just want the card for emergencies,
then a more modest spending limit may be the better route to go. How do I
want to pay back the charges? &ndash; Decide if you want to pay off the
entire balance each month or just a portion over each month. Some cards
offer advantages for both paying structures. Do special offers interest
me? &ndash; Many credit cards offer special rebates, support for a
specific organization or other member benefits for using their credit
cards. Decide if this is important to you when choosing your card.  Managing My Credit Now that you know what type of credit card you want, it
is time to manage your credit. A credit card is a responsibility, not a
right. Understanding why you want a credit card, knowing how the credit
card process works and picking a credit card that works best for you will
help you avoid debt management pitfalls. Use your credit card to extend
your buying power while keeping in mind that a credit card is not free
money . To maintain a good credit rating, you will need to pay your credit
card statements in a timely manner, according to your agreed-upon terms of
use. Be responsible with your credit and enjoy the benefits credit card
possession can bring. If you have questions or concerns about what is the
right card for your specific credit or financial need, talk to a
professional financial advisor. Take the extra step and be sure you
understand everything you need to know before applying for a credit card.
