Credit Score? If you have ever wandered how the credit bureaus come up
with your credit score you are not alone. It is one of the more arcane
things in shadows of the financial world. You may have heard about how
certain actions or behaviors, like being late with a credit card payment
or having too many cards in your wallet, can negatively affect scores.
But, that�s only a small piece of the puzzle.  There is, in fact, a very definitive algorithm that goes into making up a
credit score or �Fico� score. Even the term Fico is enigmatic, for that
matter. But it actually is just an acronym that stands for �Fair Isaac
Company�, the company that originally developed the credit scoring
methodology. While the exact recipe of the credit score is a tightly
guarded trade secret, there are some general guidelines that comprise the
final numbers. Listed below are the financial behaviors and related
factors along with the percentage weighting that each contributes to an
overall credit score: 35% - An individual�s history of making credit
payments on time 30% - The total amount of debt being carried along with
available credit  15% - The age of an individual�s open credit lines more history is better
10% - The frequency with which someone applies for new credit 10% - Wild
card factors such as the types of credit lines In general, most of the
factors that influence credit scores are within the power of consumers to
change for the better. All it takes is a consistent dose of financial
self-discipline to always make payments on time, not carry too much debt
on any one credit card, don't close older accounts unless absolutely
necessary and use discretion when applying for new credit. If you are
