Holiday Spending Can Lead to Financial Hangovers The holiday season can be
a great time of year for being with family and friends and exchanging
gifts. But with the average household spending almost $1,100 on holiday
gifts and often charging most of that on credit cards, January can bring
some sobering wake up calls when the bills arrive in the mail.  But if you know how to play your cards right, it doesn�t have to be a
chilly winter of discontent in your household. First off, be sure to pay
whatever bills you may have immediately due as soon as you are able. Late
payments, even if you�re only a few hours past the due date stipulated in
your cardmember agreement, can trigger a landslide of unpleasant and
expensive rate adjustments. In particular, default pricing will usually
kick in, raising your interest rates up to 30.99% in some cases. And,
don't be complacent if you are currently enjoying a low interest rate
introductory period. If you read the fine print in the terms and
conditions of your credit card agreement, you automatically lose such
grace periods and immediately get re-priced to the highest rates allowable
by law.  Perhaps a prudent thing to consider for those with less than attractive
interest rates is a new balance transfer credit card that offers 0% APR
for 12 months and low variable interest rates thereafter. This can allow
you to move those balances racked up over the holidays to greener pastures
and steadily pay them down during 2006. Nothing is worse than still paying
interest on last year's presents when the next holiday season comes up,
not to mention still owing the entire principal amount to the credit card
issuer. So, if you are not one of the savvy or lucky Americans with a
super low credit card rate, now is the time to start shopping for your
next credit card. Issuers know that inertia works in their favor and most
people won't go to the trouble to move their balances. But CreditCards.com
has eliminated the hassle involved with finding a better credit card. Now
you can compare leading 0% balance transfer offers side by side to find
the one that offers the features that best suits your needs. And a great
