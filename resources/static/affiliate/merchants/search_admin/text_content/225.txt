Approved For An Instant Approval Credit Card! Now What Happens? It's a
great feeling when you receive approval for anything you do but it's
especially gratifying when it comes to an instant approval credit card.
There is something intensely personal about one's finances and
creditworthiness that creates a good feeling of validation when that
credit card with an instant approval decision comes back with a resounding
Yes!  So once the good news has been received what comes next? Well, some credit
card issuers may say they offer credit cards with instant approval but
what they provide is actually just a conditional approval to keep you
satisfied while they pull a full credit report from the three credit
bureaus after the fact in order to cover their bases. This process is
actually called instant decision by the banks but is not a true instant
approval credit card. The banks and credit card issuers that are included
within the CreditCards.com links for Instant Approval Credit Cards only
include those that are truly Instant Approval , so rest assured we are
aware of this difference. A common expectation of consumers who seek
instant approval credit cards is that they will immediately have access to
the credit that has been approved by the bank or credit card issuer. In
some cases this may be true but in general consumers will have to wait one
or two weeks for their physical credit cards to show up in the mail before
they can actually make purchases. There is also an additional layer of
identity validation that is involved once the physical card shows up in
order to protect the bank and the consumer from identity theft. The
activation process involves calling from the home phone listed in the
original application and verification of the last four digits of the
consumer's social security number. Typically instant use or instant credit
type accounts are offered in conjunction with major retailers to provide
extra impetus to make a big ticket purchase. Many private label store
cards provide this type of credit with an extra incentive of getting 10%
off the first purchase. But beware of the impact of having too many of
these types of trade lines open as they can adversely impact your personal
credit score.  Another factor to consider before making an instant approval credit card
application is either knowing or having a good idea of your credit score.
Most credit decisions made by banks and lending institutions in the U.S.
are based on what is called a FICO score, which is calculated by a company
called Fair Isaac & Company. Those with less than good credit will usually
be declined through an instant approval credit card application process,
which can in turn further degrade the consumer's credit score due to
excessive credit bureau inquiries.  Want to know more about instant approval credit cards? Below are articles
