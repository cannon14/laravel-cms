Miles Ahead with the Discover Miles Card The options for earning free
airline travel using a credit card have been increasing in recent years.
In the past, you had to pay an annual fee to use a specific airline credit
card in order to earn a free ticket. And, you had to use those miles to fly
only on that particular airline. While there are advantages to
airline-specific co-branded credit cards, they do come at a price.  Nowadays, there are great options for earning miles that can be used for
free travel on any major U.S. airline. The Discover Miles Card offers an
exciting program that allows cardmembers to earn one mile per dollar spent
on the card. And, here�s the kicker, there�s no annual fee � ever. That�s
probably the biggest difference between the Discover Card and other cards
issued in partnership between major banks and major airlines. The Discover
Miles Card offers other consumer-friendly features that you wouldn�t expect
from an airline frequent flyer rewards card. Things like 0% introductory
APR on purchases and balance transfers for a full 12 months � and no
blackout dates when it comes time to book that free airline flight.
Airline credit cards normally don't provide the most competitive interest
rates because they offer such rich rewards to consumers. But with the
Discover Card you can have your cake and eat it too.  And, if you�ve ever tried cashing in your miles from one of the major
airline frequent flyer programs, you know that it isn�t quite as simple as
picking up the phone and booking your preferred departure time. Quite
typically, customers are faced with a confusing array of blackout dates
that seem to fall on the most desired vacation dates. And, the seats
available for reward travel are usually quite limited on each flight. So
even if there are seats for sale to the general public, the airlines won't
always allow them to be booked with frequent flyer mile redemptions. This
is where the no-blackout date feature of the Discover Miles Card pays off
in spades. The way a generic airline credit card like the Discover Miles
Card works is that the reward currency miles are converted to dollars by
the issuing bank upon redemption. This conversion is normally at a rate of
$.01 per mile. In other words, once the cardmember has reached 24,000 miles
they can redeem their miles for a discount domestic coach roundtrip airline
ticket on any major airline. Behind the scenes Discover takes the 24,000
miles and converts it to $240, which is then used to purchase a discount
ticket on your behalf. Discover Card is using its bargaining clout in
combination with their travel agency to get you to your dream destination
at a bargain price.  The only possible downside of this process is that miles earned on a
generic airline miles card can not be combined or added to an airline�s
frequent flyer program totals. That�s because, as mentioned above, the
miles are really just points that are being converted to dollars by
Discover and aren't the same type of miles currency that the major
airlines offer. So, if you are interested in the most flexibility with the
least cost, a generic airlines credit card like the Discover Miles Card
might be for you.  Want to know more about frequent flyer & airline credit cards? Below are
