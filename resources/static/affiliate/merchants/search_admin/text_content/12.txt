Cards – How to Save on Your Next Vehicle Automobile Rebate Credit Cards –
How to Save on Your Next Vehicle  It's easier now than ever to get a good deal on a new car, with Employee
Discount pricing on many domestic and foreign models and relatively low
interest rates. But how can a person save even more on their next car or
truck? One word…plastics. As in credit cards, that is. Major credit card
issuers have long standing partnerships with auto makers and the list has
grown recently to include almost every manufacturer. Credit card programs
such as the GM Card , Volkswagen Platinum Visa and Subaru MasterCard offer
up to 5% cash back rebates that can be applied toward the purchase of the
manufacturers new cars, trucks and SUVs. The Volkswagen Platinum Visa card
allow cardholders to apply rebates toward new Volkswagen cars and SUVs
along with VW gear, VW service, and even interesting merchandise not
related to Volkswagen.  Also of note, there are generic automobile rebate credit cards on the
market, like the Driver's Edge MasterCard from Citibank. The Driver's Edge
card allows cardholders to earn rebates that can be applied toward any make
and any model of new or even used car purchase, as well as maintenance
costs on a car they already own. And, the card pays a full 6% rebate on
everyday purchases at supermarkets, drugstores and gas stations. These
types of generic automobile rebate programs can be a great deal for people
who don't have long term loyalty toward a certain vehicle manufacturer.
Also, people's car needs and desires shift over time, so while you might
want a Corvette from GM today, a Honda minivan might be more appealing in
a few years. So, if you like the idea of saving on the purchase of your
next vehicle, but don't know what that make of car you want it's probably
a good idea to go with a generic auto reward credit card like the Driver's
Edge MasterCard. As with most rebate credit cards, automobile rebate credit
cards allow you to earn a percentage cash back on all purchases made with
the card. Rebates earned are reflected on the cardholder billing
statement, both on a monthly and program-to-date basis. Once you get ready
to purchase a new vehicle you can have the rebates earned applied to reduce
the final negotiated cost of the car, truck or SUV. All it takes is a phone
call to your credit card issuer to get the rebate transfer put into motion.
