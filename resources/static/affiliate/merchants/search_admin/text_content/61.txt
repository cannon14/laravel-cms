Your Credit Card Rewards Program With all the options available for credit
card rewards programs offered by Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card and
American Express, consumers today can earn significant rewards for simply
their everyday expenses. What most people don't realize is that there are
several ways to increase the earning power of their rewards credit card to
get even bigger savings.  A great example of this phenomenon is the online reward programs where you
can register your rewards credit card and then earn additional points or
cash back that goes into a separate account. The Upromise Credit Card
program offers such a service where gasoline, grocery and other
participating merchant purchases made with a registered card accumulate
cash back rewards that can be applied to a tax-deferred 529 education
plan. Another example involves online shopping reward and coupon savings
programs where you can earn additional rewards and enjoy savings above and
beyond the regular rewards that come with making purchases with the credit
card. Cool Savings coupons can add horsepower to your rewards card
purchases – all that's required is to register on their site, print out
the coupons of your choice and then use your rewards credit card at the
store. Other online shopping reward programs are available on the internet
which merely require a one-time registration process and provide
significant cash back incentives on purchases made through their site with
national merchants. The programs vary but typically involve having to meet
an earnings threshold before they will mail you a check with your
earnings.  Other great sites for getting additional savings are provided by Visa ,
MasterCard , Discover and American Express . The only restriction to
enjoying online shopping discounts offered is that you must have that
company's card to participate. While these methods might require a bit
more effort than just going directly to the store or merchant website they
do offer ways to get even more mileage out of your rewards credit card. For
