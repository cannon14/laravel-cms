Your Credit Card Rewards Program Rewards credit card programs are a great
deal for most consumers, particularly those who pay off their credit card
balance every month. Many find that earning rewards can help justify
putting large purchases on a credit card rather than using some other form
of payment. But even smaller, more mundane purchases really add up so it is
important to have a strategy for leveraging your household spending to
ensure that you are getting the most value from your rewards credit card
as possible.  Listed below are some tips for harnessing your household spending habits to
get the most reward points possible out of the credit card rewards program:
If you or your spouse has a rewards credit card, request a companion card
from their bank so that you can team up to earn more rewards. Pay for
groceries with your rewards credit card – most people pay for groceries
either by check, cash or with a bank debit card. If you examine your
monthly grocery bills you will quickly notice that this is a great source
of necessary spending that can be harnessed for increased rewards. Pay
your household bills online with a rewards credit card – Many companies,
even stodgy public utility companies, have begun accepting credit cards
for immediate bill payment or scheduled recurring payments. Some, however,
may impose a convenience fee for credit card payments. It's best to
continue paying those bills by check probably. But, if you look at all the
checks you write per month there is a lot of opportunity for earning points
back for paying your cable, internet service provider, dentist, doctor,
etc.  Put your monthly rent or mortgage payment on the credit card – Several of
the nation's largest apartment property management companies along with
many mortgage companies have recently begun accepting credit cards for
monthly payments. This can be a great source of large and recurring
rewards earning, but make sure you stay disciplined and pay that
outstanding balance off at the end of the month. Even one month of finance
charges on such a large purchase could wipe out the value of the rewards
earned. The ultimate goal is to shift as much of your monthly
discretionary and non-discretionary spending as possible onto your rewards
credit card. On top of the extra rewards that you can earn there is the
added benefit of getting a monthly statement reporting all of your
spending for better record keeping.  Want to know more about reward credit cards? Below are articles and
