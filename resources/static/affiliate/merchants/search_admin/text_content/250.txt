Pro's and Con's of Prepaid Debit Cards? Prepaid debit cards began to take
off in the 1990's as credit card company's realized that a significant
portion of the U.S. population was not able to qualify for many of their
credit cards. Even among those who did qualify a certain portion often
defaulted on their outstanding balances and declared bankruptcy, which
drove up losses. An early attempt to address this market need was in the
form of a secured credit card, which involved having a credit line that
was collateralized by an equal sum of money deposited with the credit card
bank. During the first few years the secured card's credit line was set at
100% of the savings on deposit. Once a satisfactory payment history was
established by the customer the bank would begin extending gradual amounts
of credit beyond the savings total – sometimes up to 200% of the deposit.
This way the bank was able to create a stable credit card customer who
might not qualify otherwise and still limit their ultimate losses should
the customer default.  Later variations of the secured credit card took the form of prepaid debit
cards where funds were loaded directly onto a Visa or MasterCard prepaid
debit card either at a merchant location or online with a bank which
marketed the products. These products functioned just like a prepaid phone
card and essentially just converted paper currency into electronic currency
accessed via a plastic card. Prepaid debit card credit lines would always
be set at the amount deposited and would be drawn down with purchases. The
advantages of prepaid debit cards include being safer than carry cash,
worldwide functionality due to Visa and MasterCard merchant acceptance,
not having to worry about paying a credit card bill or going into debt,
the ability for anyone over the age of 18 to apply and be accepted without
regard to credit quality and the ability to reload with any amount of money
online, over the phone or at any ATM worldwide.  The disadvantages include the fact that you don't have the luxury of using
a credit card bank's funds for 25 days for free but you could also look at
that as an advantage, too . Another is if the card is lost or stolen Visa
and MasterCard have much stricter notification requirements than with a
credit card. All in all the advantages of prepaid debit cards usually
outweigh the disadvantages – especially for those individuals that don't
have access to standard credit cards due to lack of credit history or
because their credit rating is less than perfect.  Want to know more about prepaid debit cards? Below are articles and
