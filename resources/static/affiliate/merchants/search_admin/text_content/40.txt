and No Late Fees! Citibank has recently launched an innovative new credit
card that can make life easier for those of us who wait until the last
minute to pay our bills. It's called the Citi Simplicity Rewards Card and
it can really improve one’s peace of mind. And it's quite rewarding, with
a $100 gift card and ongoing rewards for every purchase dollar. The card
is similar to the Citi Platinum Select Card except that card members are
never charged a late fee as long as they use their Simplicity Card at
least once per billing period for a purchase or cash advance.  As mentioned, the Citi Simplicity Rewards Card is truly rewarding, paying 1
ThankYou point on all purchases. And, for the first 12 months cardholders
can even earn 5 ThankYou points on gas station and drugstore purchases!
ThankYou points can be earned and redeemed for gift cards, electronics and
travel rewards in no time. Cardholders also receive free membership into
the ThankYou Network, which offers exclusive member-only deals on
merchandise and entertainment. The Citi Simplicity Card features 0% APR on
purchases and balance transfers for 12 months, no annual fee and no balance
transfer fee. The Simplicity Card also comes with Citi Identity Solutions,
which provides state of the art fraud protection. Through ongoing customer
research, Citi has realized that real life sometimes prevents their
customers from making payments on time. That’s why they have created this
new product feature that will waive late fees. Citi is not encouraging
customers to be late, but rather wanted to provide a way to avoid
penalizing those who are occasionally late by waiving late fees with the
Citi Simplicity Credit Card.  Citi Simplicity Card cardmembers should try to avoid being late with
payments, however, as with any credit card higher interest rates could be
triggered on outstanding balances and credit history could be negatively
impacted if you miss the payment due date. But, by having no late fees
added to the mix, Citi hopes to maintain loyal customers for the long
term. Citibank also goes the extra mile by offering free, helpful tools to
help you protect your credit. For other credit or credit card related news
