Rewards and Cash Back Business credit cards used to be plain vanilla – a
no frills card with the business name on the front that served as a way to
separate business spending from personal spending. Now business credit
cards offer as many reward options as personal credit cards. Most major
issuers of Visa and MasterCard as well as the Discover Card and American
Express companies offer a wide variety of business credit cards that
feature rewards programs in addition to a host of other benefits.  Business Credit Cards With Miles and Frequent Flier Programs Business
travel and entertainment have been around for as long as business but now
business owners can leverage their spending, as well as the spending of
their employees, to earn significant travel related rewards. Miles earned
through spending on business credit cards can be applied for additional
free business travel or given to employees of the company for personal
use. The CitiBusiness Premier Pass card offers mileage rewards that can be
used on any airline while cards like the American Airlines AAdvantage
Business card offer business travel rewards on specific airlines. It can
be a nice benefit to earn a free vacation flight or vacation package by
just putting required travel expenses on the corporate credit card.  Cash Back Business Credit Cards Numerous business credit cards offer cash
back rewards for business spending. As with airline miles these rewards
can be used as a bonus back to the company or employees. The Business Cash
Rebate Card from American Express along with the Advanta Platinum with
Rewards Card offer up to 5% cash back on all business credit card
purchases. The dollars that can be earned are often significant since
business spending, even for the smallest companies, normally dwarfs
personal spending. Rewards Credit Cards For Small Business Earning reward
points through small business credit card spending can be very exciting
when you see what can be purchased with those points. American Express
offers a great selection of merchandise and travel options with their
Membership Rewards program. Business credit cards that offer points
rewards typically earn at a rate of 1 point per dollar spent on the card
but American Express often sweetens the deal with numerous opportunities
for small businesses to earn multiple points per dollar spent for various
categories of purchases or through specific merchant promotions.  Choosing the right business credit card reward program is a matter of
choice but they all offer a small business extra value. Want to know more
