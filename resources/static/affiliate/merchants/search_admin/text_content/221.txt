for Every Occasion Whether you are in search of a super low 0% APR credit
card that offers platinum benefits, cash back or travel rewards, car
purchase rebates or even the ability to establish new credit, HSBC has you
covered.  HSBC is a relatively new name to the American banking landscape, but it is
one of the largest financial organizations on the planet. HSBC stands for
Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and has banking operations in
Europe, Asia and now North America. A few years ago HSBC purchased
Household Bank, a leading issuer of consumer credit. The acquisition
provided HSBC, based in London, with a firm foothold on the U.S. credit
card market. With the purchase of Household, HSBC acquired several premier
card relationships. Chief among these was the GM MasterCard . The GM Card
was one of the first and largest co-branded reward credit cards that
launched the innovative approach of earning a reward currency for simply
using a credit card. Now, the credit card marketplace features many such
programs offered in partnership with virtually every brand of automobile.
But the GM Card was first and continues to be a consumer favorite.  Rounding out the reward credit card menu offered by HSBC are two very
competitive reward programs. The HSBC MasterCard Cash Back Rewards Card
provides a full 1% cash back on all purchases, while the HSBC MasterCard
Cash or Fly Rewards Card offers either cash back or travel rewards good
for free flights on any U.S. airline. The final, though not least
important product in the HSBC lineup is the Orchard Bank Credit Card. This
product is specifically designed for those individuals who have no credit
history and need to establish a credit rating. The card is also designed
for those with less than perfect and even bad credit. For individuals that
have experienced bankruptcy, it can be a needed lifeline to help regain
financial standing with lenders and credit rating agencies. So, as you can
see, HSBC has carefully studied the credit card market to understand the
various needs of different consumer segments to provide cards for every
need. To view the entire selection of cards offered by the bank, please
