for Credit Cards 2005 is winding down with the annual ritual of frenzied
holiday spending, largely aided by credit cards. So, what has the year
been like in the fantastic plastic world? Mostly the big news has been
about rate increases and more increases, and then a few more increases
after that for good measure.  The Federal Reserve, after having cut the prime lending rate over a dozen
times in a row in previous years, has consistently ratcheted up the cost
of borrowed funds over the past 12 months. In fact, 2005 has seen over 7
increases, with a total of 12 upward movements in the prime rate since
June of last year. And, with continuing news of lower employment
statistics coupled with robust retail sales the rate increases will most
likely continue into 2006. This year's prime rate hikes have landed
squarely in the pocketbooks of many Americans, since virtually all major
credit card issuers employ variable APRs. Only those who are currently
enjoying a rate holiday with a 0% introductory APR period or those who
don't carry a balance from month to month are shielded from the pain of
higher interest rates.  An unfortunate nexus of higher rates also formed this year in conjunction
with the passing of major bankruptcy reform legislation and the increase
of required minimum payments. So not only are Americans getting hit with
higher rates, but those who only make minimum payments must double this
obligation from 2% to 4% of what they owe. And the options for getting
relief from creditors have dramatically decreased for these unlucky soles.
Hopefully, the maxed out masses will be able to weather this perfect storm
when the post-holiday bills begin arriving. Other notable events in the
credit card arena have centered on the continuing consolidation of the
major credit card issuers. Bank of America purchased MBNA, one of the top
five issuers, making the soon to be combined company the second largest
card issuer behind Citigroup. JP Morgan Chase completed its merger with
Bank One, placing it in third place in terms of total number of credit
card customers and receivables outstanding. The wave of bank
consolidations in 2005 even prompted a one-time player in the market to
reconsider its decision to stay out of the fray. Wachovia, itself a result
of a 2002 merger of First Union and Wachovia National Bank, decided to
reenter the card market this year after having sold off most of its credit
card accounts to MBNA a few years ago.  A few new product introductions also include the Blink technology offered
on many Chase credit cards and the JetBlue Card from American Express .
The Chase Blink technology allows the card holder to simply wave their
cards near special readers at participating national retailers to make a
credit card transaction, purportedly saving time and adding convenience.
So, what does the coming year hold for credit cards? Only time will tell.
