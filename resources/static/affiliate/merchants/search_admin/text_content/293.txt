Using a Business Credit Card to Fund Your Startup Business credit cards
have been around for many years, but have only recently explicitly
targeted true entrepreneurs by offering special financing incentives.
American Express established the gold standard in the genre of business
credit cards and focused on the business executive with exclusive
corporate card options. But, the business card market has finally taken
notice of the backbone of the American economy – the small business
sector.  Now, many major credit card issuers like Advanta and Citibank are
aggressively going after the small business market with a diverse array of
credit card products. These financial services juggernauts are offering
everything from rewards , cash back and airline miles to huge initial
credit lines with 0% introductory periods. What isn’t explicitly stated in
most credit card offer’s features is the fact that small business owners
can leverage business credit cards for startup capital. These little
pieces of plastic can actually be the life blood to fuel and sustain a
business startup. Once the financial pump has been primed, revenue from
operations can be used to repay these micro-business loans before the
finance charges become too onerous.  For example, a small eCommerce startup might need five thousand dollars to
buy a computer, pay for a hosting service and buy an initial round of
online advertising placements. But once the initial business revenue
starts flowing in, the credit card balances can be repaid. And, if the
small business credit card used features a no-preset spending limit i.e. a
dynamic credit line the credit line will increase as larger and larger
expenditures are made and then repaid. Everyone has heard of the brazen
independent movie producers that have financed their first film with a
wallet load of personal credit cards and lived to brag about it. But many
entrepreneurs, while not exactly a risk averse group, a probably a little
wary about putting their personal finances into play for launching their
ventures. And this is where small business credit cards can come to the
rescue. Beyond mere financing, these types of credit cards can provide a
host of other benefits that are critical to small business success. These
benefits include expense and revenue tracking and the ability to download
statements into business budgeting software applications like Quicken.
Expense management can be a make or break proposition for startups, so
leveraging this aspect of a business credit card can be vital for long
term success.  So, if you are contemplating taking control of your financial future and
living out your dreams by launching a business startup, consider the
benefits of using a business credit card to fund, track and reward your
business activities. For more information on credit cards or related
