Credit and Need a Credit Card? There is a credit card for you. Think that
a bad credit rating on a credit report will prevent you from obtaining a
credit card? Think again. There are a number of companies that will issue
you a credit card even when you have bad credit and need a credit card.  A credit report reflects your credit history. Credit reports are very
important when you apply for loans for a mortgage, a car, or when you fill
out credit card applications. What are your options if you have poor or bad
credit and you need a credit card? Secure Credit or Pre-Paid Cards Secured
credit cards are a great choice. A secured credit card or a prepaid debit
card requires the user to deposit money into the credit card account
before the card can be used. Once money is deposited into the account or
you have obtained some credit, the secured credit card can be used to
purchase items. The prepaid debit card or secured credit card will not
allow you to exceed the amount of money you deposited into the account.  An Option for Students For high school and college students secured student
credit cards and prepaid debit cards are great options. A secured credit
card enables a student to begin establishing a good credit rating on his
or her credit report while learning good financial planning skills and
responsibility. Also, secured credit cards prevent the overspending that
often happens with unsecured credit cards since users only have access to
the funds that were deposited into the account. If you have a not so good
credit card you are not going to get the best credit card rates and
options available to someone with great credit. However, this doesn t mean
you can t enjoy the benefits of using credit cards or you will always have
bad credit. With a little patience, discipline and time you can improve
and repair your credit history. Before beginning any credit repair program
or applying for any credit cards, discuss your specific financial situation
with your financial advisor.  For other credit and credit card related articles, please visit our library
