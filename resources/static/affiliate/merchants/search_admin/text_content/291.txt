Which Airline Frequent Flyer Credit Card is Best? As with most consumer
products and services, defining what is best is often very subjective.
This is particularly true if the product category has become something of
a commodity, as with credit cards. Finding the best airline credit card
that allows you to earn frequent flyer miles is dependent on your personal
tastes, loyalties and needs.  For instance, do you have strong brand loyalty to a certain major airline?
If so, then it probably makes the most sense to choose a co-branded credit
card issued in partnership between the airline and a major bank or credit
card issuer . Good examples of specific airline credit cards are the Citi
Platinum Select/AAdvantage World MasterCard and the United Airlines
Mileage Plus Signature Visa Card . Virtually every major carrier offers a
co-branded credit card that allows their customers to earn frequent flyer
miles apart from flying. By leveraging everyday spending on their airline
credit cards, consumers can greatly augment the miles they earn from
flying and achieve the holy grail of all frequent flyers – free airline
tickets, first class upgrades and other travel-related perks. If you don't
have an airline preference, and prefer to shop around for the lowest priced
discount ticket before traveling, a generic miles card might be a better
choice. Most of the major credit card issuers have developed generic miles
cards in recent years that allow consumers to earn miles for card purchases
and then redeem those miles for free tickets on any major airline. The
miles are not the same as frequent flyer miles in that they can not be
combined with miles in a specific airline's frequent flyer program. Once a
mileage threshold is met, the customer can redeem by having the credit card
company use the miles on the card to buy a discount ticket from one of the
major airlines. In this sense, generic miles actually equate to dedicated
cash-back earnings that can only be used to purchase an airline ticket.  Often, consumers are confused by the fact that they can't take the miles
earned on one of these generic miles cards and roll them into their
airline's frequent flyer program account. Unfortunately, it just doesn't
work that way – generic miles are simply a different kind of currency that
can't be traded or converted to other program accounts. Another important
distinction between airline-specific and generic miles credit card
programs is that most co-branded cards carry an annual fee and generic
cards generally do not. One of the most popular generic miles cards is the
Value Miles Platinum Visa Card . Others include the Discover Miles Card and
the Citi PremierPass Card . Finding the best card for you can be quickly
accomplished by determining which category you find most appealing, either
involving specific airline credit cards or the generic miles programs. Once
this decision has been made, the choice should be easy. Good luck and bon
voyage!  Want to know more about airline credit cards? Below are articles and
