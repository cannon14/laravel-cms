or low interest credit cards can save you money on interest rate expenses
Many times, credit card companies offer a low introductory rate that will
give you a low interest rate on a credit card for only a short period of
time, usually 6 months. After that time the low introductory rate goes up
to a higher fixed interest rate. The low introductory interest rates
sometimes appear really good, but might actually cost you in the end. If
you are planning to pay off the balance before the introductory rate
expires, then credit cards with a low introductory APR or low interest
rate can actually save you money.  However, if you plan to own a credit card for an extended period of time
then a fixed low interest rate credit card might be right for you. With a
fixed low APR credit card you know what your interest rate will be. See
