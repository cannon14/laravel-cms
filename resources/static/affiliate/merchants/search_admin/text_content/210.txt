debt can be a debilitating situation that puts a drag on your personal
finances and limits your options for doing many other things in life. Say,
you want to take a big family vacation or buy that big screen plasma TV
that you've been dreaming of for the last few years. But, if you have a
large outstanding credit card balance it might be hard to justify digging
yourself into a deeper hole. It might not even be an option if you don't
have the available credit on your credit card to make that next big
purchase. Now might be the time to consider your credit card debt
consolidation options to eliminate credit card debt.  With interest rates going up and up, credit card variable APRs annual
percentage rates have been increasing in lock step. Issuers may not always
be quick to share the love when rates are going down, but you can be
assured that they will promptly pass on higher borrowing costs to their
customers when the Fed Chairman announces another prime rate increase.
Credit card consolidation can help alleviate the pain by moving balances
from a high APR to a low interest rate credit card or even one that offers
0% APR balance transfers . Credit card debt is a difficult thing to
eliminate unless you have a plan and a healthy dose of self-discipline.
Becoming debt free is definitely a goal that can be accomplished, however,
even for those with limited income. People are often amazed how much money
they waste each month on non-essential items like expensive coffee drinks,
dry cleaning and meals eaten out of the home. Many can painlessly trim over
$100 per month from their household expenditures and apply this money to
their outstanding credit card debt.  Credit card debt consolidation options are numerous for those with above
average credit. Credit card issuers aggressively compete for new balances,
since this is where they make the lion's share of their income. They are
willing to offer a low interest rate or even 0% introductory APR on
balance transfers if you move your business to their card product.
Eventually the low rate or 0% APR will expire, but in the meantime a smart
credit card customer can use that free period to pay off the balance. And,
that's where the self-discipline is required. It's very tempting to start
spending again when the burden of high finance charges is temporarily
removed. But this is the time to chop away at the outstanding balance and
embark on the road to becoming debt free by leveraging interest-free
credit card consolidation. For example, if the finance charges that were
being paid on a high-rate credit card were $200 month, this same amount
should be applied each month to pay down the balance under a 0% APR credit
card. Even though no finance charges are levied, forcing yourself to make
these payments will pay off in spades. And, once you pay off credit card
debt once and for all you can begin exploring other types of credit card
products that appeal to disciplined consumers – like a cash back credit
card that actually pays you to do your everyday shopping!  For more information on credit cards and related topics please see our
