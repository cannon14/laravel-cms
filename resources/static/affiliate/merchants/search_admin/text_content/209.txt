AAdvantage MasterCard Citibank pioneered the frequent flyer credit card
genre, with its groundbreaking partnership with American Airlines.
American was the first major airline to offer a frequent flyer program for
its best customers, who were usually business travelers. Not long after,
Citi formed an alliance with American that lasts to this day to allow
business and non-business customers to earn extra AAdvantage Miles by
using their credit card.  Recently, Citi raised the bar to new levels with the CitiBusiness
AAdvantage MasterCard . The CitiBusiness AAdvantage MasterCard offers an
astounding 20,000 frequent flyer miles just for signing up for the card.
Considering it only takes 24,000 miles to get a free domestic roundtrip
coach ticket, it shouldn't take too long for a small business owner to
reach that level with such a head start. And the incentive bonus is just
the icing on the cake considering the best-in-class basic features of the
card. Things like no annual fee for the first 12 months almost unheard of
with the major co-branded airline credit card programs , reasonable
interest rates and frequent flyer miles that never expire. As many
frequent flyers have learned, redeeming a free ticket can sometimes be
harder than earning one. Most airlines maintain strict blackout dates for
the most popular travel dates and only allocate a certain number of seats
to award tickets on most flights. But, American has made this part easy
with the CitiBusiness AAdvantage Card. Cardholders are not subject to
blackout dates and can book award ticket travel with ease through
AAdvantage Aware Travel.  So if you are looking for a business advantage when considering your next
credit card, the CitiBusiness AAdvantage MasterCard may just your ticket
to success. For more information on credit cards or related topics please
