One with the American Express One Card American Express continues its
product innovations with a completely new type of credit card, called One
from American Express , launched earlier this month. The American Express
One Card is revolutionary in that it allows card members to earn cash back
rewards that are deposited in an interest bearing savings account. Cash
back and earning something for credit card purchases have become staples
of credit card reward programs. But, actually being able to build up
savings and earning interest on those funds is something new.  The savings are generated by a special program called the Savings
Accelerator Plan, which automatically calculates and transfers 1% of
eligible purchases into an FDIC-insured high-yield savings account in the
card member's name. And when American Express states high yield, they mean
high yield currently 3.5%, effective 10/17/05 . As a product launch
incentive, American Express is offering new card members $25 to start
their new savings account at American Express Federal Savings Bank. The
first card purchase automatically activates the card member's new savings
account, so everything is handled effortlessly. Another unique feature of
this innovative card is Interest Protection . This American Express
service allows card members to permanently avoid paying interest on new
purchases made with the One Card, even if they have an outstanding
balance. Other types of credit cards generally will charge interest on new
purchases if there is an existing balance on the card.  Card members can enjoy other standard features common to other credit cards
offered by American Express, such as no preset spending limits. This
dynamic credit line provides customized and flexible spending limits that
adapt to the individual's needs and purchase patterns, not the rigid
constraints of a pre-assigned amount. Additional features include online
and offline shopping protections provided by Amex's Buyer's Assurance,
Online Fraud Protection Guarantee, Return Protection Plan and Purchase
Protection Plan. When traveling with the One Card, American Express makes
it easy with Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance, Emergency Card
Replacement, Global Assist Hotline and Travel Accident Insurance. With the
American Express One Card , people can have the prestige and utility
associated with carry a card from America's premier financial services
brand. And, they can start saving real money and earning interest on those
funds to boot. It may seem counterintuitive to spend to save, but since
much personal spending is not optional gasoline, groceries, restaurants,
dry cleaning, pharmacy items, etc. , people can harness this spending get
earn something back. So, maybe now is the time to start a new interest
bearing savings account and earn while you spend. The sooner you start,
the sooner you can begin seeing the money multiply.  For additional articles and tips about credit and credit card related
