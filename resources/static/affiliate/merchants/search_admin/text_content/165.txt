Credit One Fundamentals The American Express One Card offers an altogether
different way to save for your future. Your Card comes linked to a
competitive FDIC-insured High-Yield Savings Account. And with the Savings
Accelerator Plan, a full 1% of virtually all your eligible purchases will
be deposited into this Savings Account at American Express Bank, FSB. It's
automatically set up for you when you activate your Card. Plus you'll get
$25 to jump &ndash; start your savings after your first purchase.  Carry a balance without paying interest on new purchases Unlike most cards,
the American Express One Card offers a feature called Interest Protection.
With it, you can pay your bill in full at the end of the month or pay over
time &ndash; but you never pay interest on new purchases. So &ndash; by
choosing to pay with the American Express One Card &ndash; not only are
you free to carry a balance for last month's vacation, you can also avoid
paying interest on this week's groceries. No pre-set spending limit The
American Express One Card has no pre set spend limit, so you can spend a
little more if you need to. And to keep track of your spending, you can
use the Spend Tracking Alert to designate a monthly spend amount &ndash;
and set up e-mail or text message reminders to alert you when you've
reached that amount. Manage Your Card Account Online You can view
up-to-date billing information online, including transactions, charges,
payments and aspects of your Card account &ndash; anytime, anywhere.  Get free Additional Cards To help your savings grow faster, you can request
complimentary Additional Cards for others who are important to you. Every
eligible purchase made with those Additional Cards can add to your
High-Yield Savings. See the online One from American Express credit card
application for details about terms and conditions of offer. Reasonable
