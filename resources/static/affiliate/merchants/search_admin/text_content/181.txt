Cards Make Fast Food Even Faster in 2005 The quick service restaurant food
sector has never had it so good, with recent growth being fueled by credit
card acceptance. Restaurants like McDonalds and Wendy's have realized that
America's addiction to fast food is only rivaled by its addiction to credit
cards, so it is a marriage made in heaven. With most fast food orders
fulfilled in seconds, the major holdup in the process has traditionally
been at the cash register. With plastic payment cards added to the
equation, like credit cards , debit cards and dedicated prepaid gift cards
, the process is now starting to flow much faster.  Visa has recently reported that American's spent an average of $430 million
per week in 2005 using their credit cards, with an average ticket amount of
$10.75. The historic fast food purchase total made on credit cards has
risen from $1.7 billion in 2000 to $37 billion in 2005. And along with
this tremendous increase in credit card usage at fast food restaurants has
come a significant increase in efficiency and profitability for the major
fast food giants. For those with a rewards credit card that offers cash
back or airline frequent flyer miles , the opportunity to shift even more
of their regular spending, previously made with cash, presents a great way
to get something back for their effort. So, while waistlines might be
expanding with this extra convenience, at least the potential rewards can
make reward cardholders feel less guilty.  Want to know more about cash back credit cards? Below are articles and
