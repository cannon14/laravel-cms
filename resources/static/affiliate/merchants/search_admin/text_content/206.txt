Gas Rebate Credit Cards – Looking Better All the Time Gas prices are at an
all time high and the pain at the pump is being felt by almost everyone,
from commuters to soccer moms. A great way to help ease the pain can be
the use of a gasoline rebate credit card that allows you to lower your
monthly fuel bill in several ways.  However, many consumers who are interested in a rewards credit card are not
sure which type of card is best. Before choosing a gasoline credit card
over another type of reward credit card, such as one that offers cash back
or miles, you need to consider a few things. First, what are the motivating
factors. Do you want to reward themselves with something special, like a
merchandise item or gift certificate? Or, would you prefer to reduce or
offset an unavoidable expense category, like fuel or airline travel?
Second, do you have certain spending patterns that might allow you to get
more value out of a certain type of reward credit card. For instance, a
business traveler will often get more value out of an airline credit card
than someone who rarely flies. Or, someone who has a long commute to work
or is a traveling salesperson might get more value from a gasoline credit
card. It all depends on what you find most motivating and rewarding .
Rewards mean different things to different people – it can be
psychological or monetary.  Many gasoline rebate credit cards are issued in partnership between banks
and oil companies that require the cardholder to use a particular gasoline
retailer in order to earn and redeem their free gas an example would be the
Marathon Platinum MasterCard or the Chase Hess Visa. Other cards offer
generic earning and redemption options, allowing the cardholder to choose
where they fill up their tank, like the Discover Platinum Gas Card or the
Chase PerfectCard. These cards are considered reward credit cards, but can
also be considered cash-back credit cards, since they provide a cash
rewards against future gasoline purchases. Specifically, they allow
cardholders to earn points or a percentage cash back for every dollar they
spend on the card, and often a higher percentage rebate on gasoline
purchases. Then the cash back rebate is redeemed by being automatically
applied toward future gasoline purchases, in the form of a statement
credit. The cardholder doesn't need to do anything to collect their
earnings – they just simply keep using the card and can review their
statement to see the current and program-to-date gas savings totals.  Consumers can feel better about their monthly fuel bills, which have
doubled for many Americans in the past year, with a gas rebate credit
card. And, by leveraging their everyday spending on such things as
groceries, drugstore items, monthly utilities, dry cleaning and department
stores, people can significantly lower their gasoline cost. While there
will always be some pain felt at the pump, it can be a good feeling to see
the amount spent diminished when you review your monthly credit card
billing statement. For other credit and credit card related articles,
